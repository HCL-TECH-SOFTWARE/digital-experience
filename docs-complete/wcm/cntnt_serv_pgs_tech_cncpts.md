# Technical concepts 

Before you use the Content as a Service pages in HCL Digital Experience, familiarize yourself with its building blocks.

-   **CaaS page**

    The CaaS page is the default Content as a Service page with the unique name `ibm.portal.caas.page`.

    The CaaS page can be created by running the `install-caas-vp` task. The page uses the CaaS theme and a single Web Content Viewer portlet instance to generate the individual data representations for your content. The page can be addressed through its unique name or through the friendly name caas.

    **Important:** Portal pages and web content libraries are virtual portal scoped resources. To use Content as a Service with content from a virtual portal, you must install the CaaS page to the virtual portal first.


-   **CaaS theme**

    This theme with the unique name `wp.theme.caas` is referenced by the CaaS page. The theme ensures that no portal page aggregation-related markup gets added to the data representation strings generated by your Content as a Service presentation component.
