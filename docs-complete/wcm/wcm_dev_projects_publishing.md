# Ways to publish a project 

Publishing a project refreshes the live website with your changes.

These publishing methods are used by projects:

-   **Date**

    When **Date** is selected, all items are published as soon as all the items in the project reach a state of "pending" and the publish date that is selected in the project is reached. You can also click **Publish** in the project form before the date is reached when all items in the project reach a state of "pending".

-   **Manual**

    When **Manual** is selected, all items remain in a state of "pending" until the project is manually published by clicking **Publish** in the project form. The **Publish** function is not activated until all items in the project reach a state of "pending". Only users with editor access or higher to a project can publish a project.

-   **Automatic**

    When **Automatic** is selected, all items are published as soon as all the items in the project reach a state of "pending".


When the project is published, you can continue to review the status and version history of the items in the project by opening the project form.

**Note:** You and other users can update the same items in multiple projects. Messages are displayed when you move an item to the publish state to warn you when this event occurs.
