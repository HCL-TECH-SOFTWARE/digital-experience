# Development tasks 

Complete the development tasks that are required after the migration to ensure that your environment functions properly.

-   **[Updating portlets URL ](../migrate/mig_updating_portlets_url.md)**  
After migrating your portal environment, you must verify and update as needed the portlets URLs. In some cases, portlets have the incorrect URL after migration. URLs can be easily corrected using the XML configuration interface to export, update, and import the configurations.
-   **[Updating custom theme Dojo references ](../migrate/mig_post_dojo.md)**  
The default Dojo context root in HCL Digital Experience is /WpsContextRoot/portal\_dojo. You can find the value of WpsContextRoot in [wp\_profile\_root](../reference/wpsdirstr.md#wp_profile_root)/ConfigEngine/properties/wkplc.properties.
-   **[Enabling and upgrading JavaServer Faces portlet applications ](../migrate/mig_post_dev_jsf.md)**  
You can enable or upgrade portlet projects that use JavaServer Faces 1.x to JavaServer Faces 2.0 Facelet-based portlet projects. Refer to the Rational® Application Developer for WebSphere® Software documentation for instructions on enabling and upgrading JavaServer Faces portlet applications.
