# Docker image deployment using Docker Compose

This section presents availability of a new option to deploy HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Docker images for non-production using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This approach streamlines deployment and configuration of HCL DX 9.5 components. For more information about Docker Compose, see the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

**Pre-requisite:**

1.  Download the Docker images for the HCL DX 9.5 Container Update version you wish to deploy. From your HCL Digital Experience entitlements in the [HCL Software License Portal](https://www.hcltech.com/software/support/release), the Docker images are in the HCL\_Portal\_8.5\_9.0\_9.5\_CFs download package entry. Refer to the [Docker image list](docker.md) for the latest HCL DX 9.5 container update releases.

Find the HCL DX 9.5 Docker Compose scripts, installation and configuration instructions for non-production use in the repositories on the [HCL Software Github](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE). Use the `HCL-DX` tag to find the DX [Docker Compose](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dx-docker-compose) entry.
