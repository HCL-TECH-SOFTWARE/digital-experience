# Error message codes 

Each message code consists of a product identifier, component identifier, a unique number, and a message type identifier. The product identifier is EJP and there are many components. There are three message types: error, information, and warning.

## Example

For the following message code EJPIC0001E:

-   EJP is the product identifier
-   IC is the component identifier, installation user interface
-   0001 is the unique message number
-   E is the message type, error

During the last session, you clicked Start Configuration and the configuration was running automatically. To return to the automatic process, click Resume Configuration. Otherwise, click Cancel to run each remaining step manually.
