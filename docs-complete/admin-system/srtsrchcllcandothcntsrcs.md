# Search on secured Portal Search collections and other secured content sources 

Portal search collections are portal resources. You can therefore secure them through Portal Access Control. Consequently, users can only access and search collections to which they have access permission.

The Search Center portlet checks for access permissions of the searching users. It searches only in those search collections to which the users have access permission. For example, in the Search Center users see only the scopes containing search collections to which they have access.

Apply special care when giving users access through the search portlets to sensitive information such as web pages that have been collected from a secured website. Ideally, give only those users access permission for a search collection who have also access to the corresponding website that is being indexed and searched. Otherwise users might see documents listed, but cannot actually access them by clicking the respective link or URL. A user might see part of the information via the document summary, even if the user cannot open the document.
