# Configuring the Suggested Links view 

Customize the display of search results to show users the preferred or recommended results and associated links.

The Suggested Links view of the Tag Cloud displays predefined search results and links to users separately from the regular result set. You can add keywords to documents in the Search Center result list to control which results appear in the Suggested Links list.

To configure the Suggested Links view, proceed as follows:

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portlet Management** \> **Portlets**.

2.  Click the **Configure** icon next to the **Suggested Links** portlet.

3.  Add or edit the following parameter and the appropriate value:

    -   **numberOfLinks = \(3\)**

        Determines the maximum number that is displayed by the Suggested Links portlet. The default number is 3.

4.  Click **OK** to save the portlet configuration.

    Users can now use the Suggested Links portlet.
