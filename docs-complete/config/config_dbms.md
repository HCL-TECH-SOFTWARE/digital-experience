The database transfer option in the Configuration Wizard includes manual steps. Some manual steps include scripts for you or your database administrator to run. For reference only, you can see the manual steps in this section of the product documentation. Use the Configuration Wizard to complete the deployment configuration. The wizard generates specific instructions and scripts based on your unique input.
-   **[Oracle: Creating JCR table spaces \(Automatic Storage Management\) ](../config/oracle_create_tablespaces.md)**  
If you configured your database with Automatic Storage Management, you might need to perform additional manual instructions to create JCR table spaces when you use the Database Transfer option in the Configuration Wizard. If you select the option to let the wizard create your database schemas and assign permissions, you must perform the steps in this topic after you run the setup database script.
