# Enabling step-up authentication and/or the Remember me cookie

Using step-up authentication and/or the Remember me cookie lets you fine-tune user authentication to pages and portlets.

-   **[Enabling step-up authentication and the Remember me cookie ](../security/cfg_auth.md)**  
Step-up authentication provides different authentication levels for pages and portlets. The **Remember me** cookie is an encrypted HTTP cookie that supports authentication. You can present personalized portlets and pages in a public area without the need for users to manually authenticate. Remembered users can view anonymous pages and portlets with a standard or identified authentication level. When you provide a valid **Remember me** cookie, a user can also access protected pages and portlets that require the identified authentication level. If the authentication level is set to authenticated, the user must provide a user ID and password to view the page or portlet.
