# The Content Template Internet site template 

This template creates an internet site with Content Template theme extensions enabled. The site includes Landing pages and Index and Detail page pairs. You can add pages later with the HCL Portal site toolbar and change content on pages that allow it. You use Site Builder to install new sites by using the Internet site template.

To edit items in a site that is created by using the Internet site template, a user needs:

-   Editor access on the relevant pages
-   Editor access on the library that is created with the new site
-   Contributor access on the CTC Content, CTC Design, and the CTC Process libraries

The site has a home page and several other microsites with one or more pages. Many of the elements are reused across the site, which is styled for the page on which they appear.
