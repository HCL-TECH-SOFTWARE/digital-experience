# Print support 

The pages support printing through a print stylesheet that removes extraneous theme components and unfloats and unconstrains the main content column.

Details of the content that are only visible in the side columns can be added after the main content body in a hidden "print-only" block. Making the print-only content visible in the print stylesheet ensures that it is printed, even though the side columns are not.

The print stylesheet also inserts the HREF for each link into the output, so the link is visible when printed.

The following example shows a page with the screen layout applied.

Compare the preceding example to the same page with the print layout applied.
