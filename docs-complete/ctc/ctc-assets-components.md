# Content Template Components 

These components are used by the Content Template.

Create or modify components, such as headers, footers, list presentation components, and result designs, in your own design library. Then reference them from your microsites and your actual websites.

-   **[Component folders ](../ctc/ctc_arch_prestemp_folders.md)**  
The reusable components of presentation templates are grouped into folders.
-   **[Asset Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-assets.md)**  
Asset components are reusable files and code that are used to deliver advanced functions to a site:
-   **[Block Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-block.md)**  
Block components store reusable blocks of text, tags, and code.
-   **[Component Designs ](../ctc/ctc-components-designs.md)**  
These store reusable designs for different component types.
-   **[Component Footers ](../ctc/ctc-components-footers.md)**  
These components store reusable tags, text, and code that are used in the footer of other component designs.
-   **[Component Headers ](../ctc/ctc-components-headers.md)**  
These components store reusable tags, text, and code that are used in the header of other component designs.
-   **[Feed Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-feed.md)**  
Feed components are used to render a list of items in the form of a feed.
-   **[Field Design Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-field-designs.md)**  
These design components are used to format different component types.
-   **[Component Fragments ](../ctc/ctc-components-fragments.md)**  
These components are reused in other component designs.
-   **[Icon Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-icons.md)**  
These image components store icons that are used by the Content Template.
-   **[Inline Editing Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-inline.md)**  
These components are used to support inline editing. These are added to other component designs to enable content authoring functions.
-   **[List Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-list.md)**  
These are a set of menus, navigators, and personalization components. These retrieve the content items that are displayed in list portlets.
-   **[List Presentations ](../ctc/ctc-components-list-presentation.md)**  
You can add the List Presentation component to any page created from the List, Slideshow, or Carousel templates. The component is used to define a header, footer, and result design in one place and reuse the component on multiple pages. Pages that are created from the Block Template do not use List Presentation components.
-   **[Navigation Components ](../ctc/ctc-components-navigation.md)**  
These components are used to add navigation to your site.
