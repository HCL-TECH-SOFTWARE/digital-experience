# Using global page components 

Sometimes there will be page component configurations that are general enough that you can use them across the entire website. For example, a sitemap footer is usually the same across all pages.

The recommended approach for these page component configurations is to create a Page Components area in your root site area. Store global page component configurations here so they are not confused with other page components only used on the Home page.

Because these page components are used throughout the site, you may also want to lock down the access level that is required to modify them; putting them in their own site area makes this easier to implement.
