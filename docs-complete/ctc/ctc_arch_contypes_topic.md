# Topic content template 

The Topic template is the most general of the templates and is intended for traditional static content publishing. This type of content is long-lived, undergoing revisions over time and republished repeatedly.

The template has extra fields for entering links and attachments, provides the featured option fields, and has authoring attribution options.

This template is unique in being used in the following page templates:

-   **Stand-alone topic template**

    The Stand-alone topic template provides a single topic that you can place directly in the site navigation.

-   **Topics index template**

    The Topics index template is used for posting a list of topics.

-   **Sections index template**

    The Sections index template is used for creating hierarchical topic structures, in which sections group related topics.
