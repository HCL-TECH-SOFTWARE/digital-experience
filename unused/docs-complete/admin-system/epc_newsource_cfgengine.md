# Creating new categories for the Page Component palette by using the Web Content Authoring Portlet 

For a site area or content item, add a keyword to its profile to define categories in the Page Component palette. This was known as the Content palette prior to CF08. Content items in the site area appear in the new category of the site toolbar.

Add ibm.portal.toolbar.NewContent as a keyword to either a site area or content item to have it appear in the Page Component palette. If you add ibm.portal.toolbar.NewContent as a keyword in a site area, any content items located under this site area will also be displayed within the Page Components palette. This is useful if you have a large number of page components and want to display them within sub-folders within the Page Components palette.

1.  Click the **Applications** menu icon in the toolbar.

2.  Click **Content** \> **Web Content Authoring**.

3.  Find or create the site area or content item to use as the new category.

4.  Expand the Profile section of the site area.

5.  Add the keyword ibm.portal.toolbar.NewContent.

6.  Save and close the dialog.
