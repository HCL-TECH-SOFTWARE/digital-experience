# Deleting users and groups 

You can delete a user or user group from HCL Portal.

1.  From the **Users and Groups** page, choose the link for deleting either a user or a user group:

    -   To delete a user, click **All Authenticated Portal Users**.
    -   To delete a user group, click **All Portal User Groups**.
2.  Select the user or user group that you want to delete.

3.  Click the **Delete** icon. A dialog box warns that the selected user or group information and all private data will be removed from the database.

4.  Click **OK** to save your changes, or **Cancel** to exit without saving your changes.

    **Note:** Deleting a user group from the portal does not delete the members of the group.
