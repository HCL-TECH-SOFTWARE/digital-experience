# Modifying a virtual portal 

You can modify a virtual portal by using either the Virtual Portal Manager portlet or the appropriate configuration task.

You can use the Virtual Portal Manager portlet to change the following settings of an existing virtual portal:

-   The title of the virtual portal.
-   The description of the virtual portal.
-   The realm of the virtual portal.

    **Note:** Apply special care when you are changing the realm of a virtual portal. Changing the realm of a virtual portal might change the users and groups who have access to the virtual portal and to resources of that virtual portal. This includes the possibility that the sub-administrator of the virtual portal can lose the rights to administer the portal. If this happens, change the realm back to the original realm by using the **initial** portal installation as an administrative interface.

-   The theme of the virtual portal.
