# Prepare UX Screen Flow Manager 

If you are migrating from Version 8.0.0.1 with the UX Screen Flow Manager \(UXFM\) enabled, then you must remove the dialog definitions, and then uninstall UXFM before you migrate to Version 8.5. Before you remove the dialog definitions and uninstall UXFM, it is highly recommended that you export your dialog definitions, and when migration is complete, you can import your dialog definitions into your upgraded system. If you do not export your dialog definitions, then your data will be lost.
