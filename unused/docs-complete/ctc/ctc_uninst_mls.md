# How to delete the CTC Multilingual Demo libraries 

Uninstallation does not delete the CTC Multilingual Demo libraries automatically. These libraries must be manually deleted.

You need to manually delete the following libraries:

-   CTC Demo AR
-   CTC Demo DE
-   CTC Demo ES
-   CTC Demo ZH

Refer to the Multilingual Solution documentation for instructions on how to uninstall the Multilingual Solution itself.
