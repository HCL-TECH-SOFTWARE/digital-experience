# What's in the box? \| Content Template Catalog

Content Template Catalog is delivered as a Portal Application Archive, which is a package of HCL Portal and HCL Web Content Manager assets and code that is installed using the Portal Solution Installer. After installing this package you have a full set of templates for building content-oriented HCL Digital Experience sites.

The package contains the following components.

-   **Page templates and pre-configured portlets**

    The core assets are a set of page templates that allow rapid assembly of a site structure, with built-in tooling for contribution and management, and a set of portlets for dropping additional content onto the pages.

-   **Content-oriented theme extensions**

    The theme extensions installed with Content Template enhance website rendering on mobile devices and allow you to add Content Template portlets to any page. The extensions also offer a content profile with more navigation and layout choices than the base Portal theme. You can easily change styling to suit your site's graphic design.
