# Creating new Web templates 

When creating new Web template types, you create new items, which are copied from generic templates, and place them in a new design library.

When creating new Web template types, you must copy and create:

1.  A new authoring template.
2.  A new presentation template.
3.  A new authoring tool component that is stored in the Inline Editing folder.

You then create a new mapping between the authoring and presentation templates, and update reference in your design to point to the new authoring tool component.

## Applying the changes

If there are any default content items that are associated with the templates or components, you need to update them.
