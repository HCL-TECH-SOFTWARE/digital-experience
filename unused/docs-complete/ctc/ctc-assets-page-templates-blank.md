# Blank Landing Page Template 

This is used to create a blank landing page. This must be used instead of the Basic page template on Content Template sites.

When a new page is created by using this page template, no portlets are added to the page, but the default Content Template landing page site hierarchy is created under this path: Your Library/Your Site Path/Your Page Name. The page is also associated with the root site area in the newly created site hierarchy.

You can then add Content Template portlets to the blank page.
