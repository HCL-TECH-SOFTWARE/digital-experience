# The role of the Context Override field 

Setting a context override is the key to getting many of the components to select content throughout the site. Overrides also allow reuse of these components \(for example, by avoiding the hardcoding of site areas into menus and rules\).

The components that you select in a page component configuration require a context to run in. Sometimes the context is the current page context, but it can also be a different context, such as:

-   When displaying content from up or down the site hierarchy.
-   When cross-referencing to other site areas.
-   To scope a list to a specific area if it is retrieving content too broadly.
