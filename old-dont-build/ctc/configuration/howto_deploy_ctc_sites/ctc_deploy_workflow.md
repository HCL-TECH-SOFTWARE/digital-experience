# Workflow for Content Template pages

All of the templates in Content Template Catalog set the workflow for items to a single workflow. You can modify this workflow or use one of the following strategies to integrate your own workflows.

-   **Manual option**

    Create more workflows and users can select the correct one.

-   **Automatic option**

    Modify the workflow into a routing workflow. You create a workflow plug-in and put this plug-in into the single stage in the workflow. The plug-in's job is to use an algorithm to select the appropriate workflow automatically and switch the workflow on the content.
