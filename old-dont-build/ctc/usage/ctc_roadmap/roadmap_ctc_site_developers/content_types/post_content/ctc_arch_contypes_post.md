# Post content

Post content, such as News and Alerts, is posted on the site at a specific time and is removed from the site as it ages.

-   **[News content](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_news.md)**  
News is a general-purpose content type for posting current information to your site. News items are listed from newest to oldest, and generally fall out of view as time passes. The use of a filter form on the index allows users to search back through past news.
-   **[Press release content template](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_press.md)**  
Use the Press release content template to post press releases on your site. It is similar to the News template, but includes extra fields for follow-up contact information and to record the original release date.
-   **[Alerts content template](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_alert.md)**  
Alerts are typically used on intranets. Use them to post important information that you want readers to take note of and potentially act on.
-   **[Communication content template](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_comm.md)**  
The Communication content template is used for internal communications, such as executive communications and postings from a particular organizational unit. You can add a shared communications area that is used by a number of executives or units, or more typically, you can create a communications area for each.
