# DX Core server | HCL Digital Experience


This topic provides information about restarting the DX Core server by using the
 DXClient tool.


## Restart DX Core server


The restart-dx-core command is used to restart the DX Core
 server.



Command description

This command invokes the restart-dx-core tool inside the
 DXClient and runs the DX Core restart
 action.
```
dxclient restart-dx-core
```


Help command

This command shows the help information for
 `restart-dx-core` command
 usage:
```
dxclient restart-dx-core -h
```


Command options

 Use this attribute to specify the username that is required for
 authenticating with the DX
 Core
```
-dxUsername <value> 
```

 Use this attribute to specify the password that is required for
 authenticating with the DX
 Core
```
-dxPassword <value>
```

 Use this attribute to specify the config wizard home (route change only
 in case of Open Shift Kubernetes Enviornment, otherwise same as
 hostname) that is required for authenticating to the
 cw\_profile
```
-dxConnectHostname <value>
```

 Use this attribute to specify the port number of the cw\_profile(for
 Kubernetes Environment dxConnectPort is
 443)
```
-dxConnectPort <value>
```

 Use this attribute to specify the username that is required for
 authenticating to the
 cw\_profile
```
-dxConnectUsername <value>
```

 Use this attribute to specify the password that is required for
 authenticating to the
 cw\_profile
```
-dxConnectPassword <value>
```

Specify either the
 `dxProfileName` or `dxProfilePath` of
 the DX core server: * Use this attribute to specify the profile name of the DX core
 server (for example:
 `wp_profile`)
```
-dxProfileName <Profile name of the DX core server>
```

**OR*** Use this attribute to specify the profile path of the DX server
 (for example:
 `/opt/HCL/wp_profile`)
```
-dxProfilePath <Path of the DX core server profile> 
```

All the above command options can also be configured inside the
 config.json configuration file of the DXClient tool, available in the
 <working-directory>/store directory of the
 DXClient installation. Note: If you have installed
 DXClient using the node package file, then you can find the
 config.json file in the following path:
 dist/src/configuration.
The values that are passed through the command line override the default
 values.



Example Usage:



```
dxclient restart-dx-core -dxUsername <dxUsername> -dxPassword <dxPassword> -dxConnectHostname <hostname> -dxConnectPort <dxConnectPort> -dxConnectUsername <dxConnectUsername> -dxConnectPassword <dxConnectPassword> -dxProfileName <Profile name of the DX core server>
```



Limitation

In Kubernetes based deployments, if there are more than one pod for the
 core container, the restart command of DXClient only restarts the pod it
 is connected to and not all running pods. For a full restart of all
 pods, leverage using the Kubernetes interfaces like
 `kubectl`.
