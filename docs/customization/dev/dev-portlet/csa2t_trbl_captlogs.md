# Capturing the log statements

Client side log statements are written to the JavaScript console of your browser.

There are various ways of accessing the data written to the JavaScript console, depending on the type of browser that you use. For example, in Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 8 you access the console by selecting **Tools** \> **Developer Tools**. For Firefox, various plug-ins are available that provide access to the console, for example the Firebug plug-in.
