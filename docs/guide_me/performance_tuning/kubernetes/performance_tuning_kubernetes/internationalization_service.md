# Internationalization Service Tuning

An internationalized (i18n) application can be configured to interact with users from different regions in culturally appropriate ways. The internationalization service enables you to configure and manage an internationalization context for an application.

This feature is needed by the WebSphere i18n classes. If your application code is not using the following classes, it is safe to disable this service.

- com.ibm.websphere.i18n.context.UserInternationalization
- com.ibm.websphere.i18n.context.Internationalization
- com.ibm.websphere.i18n.context.InvocationInternationalization Note that Portal does not make use of these classes internally.

**How to Set**

In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console

Servers → Server Types → WebSphere application servers → WebSphere_Portal → Container Services:Internationalization service

Uncheck “Enable service at server startup”.
