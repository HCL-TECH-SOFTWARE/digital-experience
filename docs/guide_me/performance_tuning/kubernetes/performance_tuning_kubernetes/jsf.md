# Java Server Faces (JSF)

The [Apache JSF document](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javaserverfaces.html){target="_blank"} mentions three items that led to a minor improvement:

PROJECT_STAGE=production

COMPRESS_STATE_IN_SESSION=false

SERIALIZE_STATE_IN_SESSION=false

Those are set in the web.xml for the JSF portlet.

## Best Practices

A JSF portlet should follow some best practices. This is not a complete list of best practices. Rather it is a list of practices that allowed our evaluation to get improved throughput.

- If you're displaying large JSF dataTables, they should be paginated. Displaying a thousand rows at once via a JSF dataTable is expensive
- Do not fetch database records via a bean, which you are not going to use. Populating the beans is expensive. Avoid that overhead by fetching only records your application is going to use.
- Data access beans should not perform a 'context lookup' for every database access like this:

javax.naming.InitialContext ctx = new javax.naming.InitialContext(); datasource = (DataSource) ctx.lookup(properties.getProperty("DATASOURCE"));

This is an expensive call. It should be done once and the result should be stored and reused for all later invocations.

- Memory can be freed faster if the managed bean data are stored in the request scope instead of in the user session scope.
