# Portal Caching

Internally, Portal uses a number of DynaCache instances to cache data from the Portal user databases and LDAP. Tuning the sizes of these caches can improve performance. See the Cache Manager Service sections for the cache sizes used in base Portal performance measurements. For a description of the various Portal caches, see the Base Portal Cache Instances section.
