# WCM Cache Instances

_WCM Item Caching_ 

services/cache/iwk/strategy

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores internal WCM items. Any WCM item read from the database will first check this cache.

WCM items cover Content, Workflow, Workflow Stages, Workflow actions, Taxonomies, Categories, Authoring Templates, Presentation Templates, Sites, Siteareas, and all Library Components. The cache entry will be updated or cleared when its corresponding WCM Item is updated or deleted.

_WCM Summary_

services/cache/iwk/summary – WCM summaries

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores summaries of WCM Items. The summaries are used to display in lists in the authoring portlet or used internally in the WCM API to calculate WCM Item Document IDs used for Iterators. The cache entry will be cleared when a WCM Item is updated that will affect this summary.

_WCM Basic Caching_ 

services/cache/iwk/module

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache is used for WCM Basic caching. See the InfoCenter on setting up Basic caching. The Basic cache stores the entire response. The key is based on the URL only, so all users will see the same response.

_Advanced & Resources_ 

services/cache/iwk/processing

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: 1 month (configurable), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores the binary MIME for file and image resources in WCM. The maximum size of resources to store is set in the WCMConfigService.properties file as the property resourceserver.maxCacheObjectSize (in kb). Resources over this size are not cached and are streamed directly to the response. The expiry is set in the same file as: resourceserver.cacheExpiryDate. The cache entry will be cleared when that resource is updated.

This cache also stores page data if WCM Advanced caching is enabled. See the HCL Digital Experience Help Center for enabling WCM Advanced caching. The processing cache stores advanced caches for the following types:

- Site: Similar to “Basic” Caching except that “Connect Tags” are processed each time
- User: Stores a copy of an item in the cache for each user
- Secured: Users that belong to the same groups will access the same cached items
- Personalized: Users who have selected the same personalization categories and keywords, and who belong to the same Group, will access the same cached items

Note that the ‘session’ option for Advanced caching is not stored in the processing cache, but the ‘session’ cache.

_Session Cache_

services/cache/iwk/session

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores the page data for when session advanced caching is enabled. See the InfoCenter for enabling WCM Advanced caching.

_Menu_

services/cache/iwk/menu

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores WCM Menu entries. An entry comprises the Content IDs associated with a particular menu. The entries are retrieved and cached without applying security. Whenever a user needs that menu’s results, their specific security will then be applied to the cached results. A dynamic menu, which is one that is affected by the current user’s context (e.g. based on categories in a user’s profile) will store a separate cache entry for each different context. The cache entry will be cleared when a WCM Item is updated that will affect this menu.

_Navigator_

services/cache/iwk/nav

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores parent to child relationships that comprise a WCM navigator. A complex navigator might have multiple parent to child relationships (e.g. if siblings are included). The navigator entry is made up of the IDs of the parent and children. This cache will be cleared upon any WCM Item update in the system.

_Absolute Path_

services/cache/iwk/abspath See description below.

services/cache/iwk/abspathreverse

Default size: 5000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

These two caches store JCR path to WCM item ID relationships (one cache is used for Path-to-ID relationships and the other for ID-to-Path relationships). The cache entry will be cleared when a WCM Item is updated that will affect it. Typically these two caches should be configured to have the same size.

_Missed Items_

services/cache/iwk/missed

Default size: 5000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores JCR paths that do not exist. This is used primarily for multi-locale solutions to determine if items of other locales exist or not. The cache entry will be cleared when a WCM Item is updated that will affect it.

_Project Render Information Cache_ 

services/cache/iwk/projectrenderinfo

Default size: 100, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores the computed project item state information that is used to perform project rendering previews. Each project will have a single entry in the cache. The information in the cache includes the calculated relationships of draft to published items and vise- versa. This cache is used to dynamically overlay project changes over the published site. The cache entry will be cleared when WCM items are removed from projects or purged.

_Legacy Cache_

services/cache/iwk/site

This is an internal cache to support some old legacy capabilities of WCM. It is not used in Portal scenarios in version 9.5.

_Library_

services/cache/iwk/global

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache contains a lookup for library id, name and path to the library object. This is pre-populated up to the cache size at Portal startup.xmlformat

services/cache/iwk/libparent – Library Parent

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

This cache stores a list of all children library ids to a given parent id. This was introduced for Quickr to group libraries within a teamspace.

_WCI Object IDs_ 

wci/wcmobjectids

Default size: 2000, default lifetime: infinite (-1), usage pattern: regular.

The WCI object ids cache does not have a significant effect on performance. It is used internally by the WCI consumer to ensure that concurrent distributed feed consumers do not cause inconsistencies.

_User Cache_

Size is fixed to 2,000. By default, this is disabled.

This cache operates using a Least Recently Used algorithm. It is not shared across nodes in the cluster and it does not use DynaCache. It does not update when LDAP changes. It is disabled by default but can be enabled through setting: user.cache.enabled=true

**How to Set**

This is set in WCMConfigService.properties. To enable you need to run a module called MemberCacheManager or restart the server.

To enable the module, add the following to WCMConfigService.properties:

- connect.businesslogic.module.template.class=com.presence.connect.wmmcomms
- connect.businesslogic.module.template.remoteaccess=true
- connect.businesslogic.module.template.autoload=false
