# WCM Caching

For many functions, WCM utilizes the same caches as base Portal. In addition, there are also WCM specific caches. These are documented in the WCM Cache Instances section.

The WCM Rendering Portlet can also take advantage of Portlet Fragment Caching. See the Portlet Fragment Cache section above on how to enable this for a specific WCM Rendering Portlet.
