# WCM Caching

WCM leverages many of the same caches as the base Portal, in addition to its own WCM-specific caches. For details on these, refer to [WCM Cache Instances](.//internal_portal_cache/wcm_cache_instances.md).

The WCM Rendering Portlet can also benefit from Portlet Fragment Caching. For instructions on enabling this for a specific WCM Rendering Portlet, refer to the [Portlet Fragment Cache](./portlet_fragment_cache.md) section.
