# Use of Dynamic Content Features

HCL Portal contains dynamic content support infrastructure which supports two dynamic content features: dynamic user interfaces and attribute-based administration. If neither of these features is being used, the dynamic content support can be disabled. Note that attribute-based administration is only one use of the Personalization capabilities in WebSphere Portal. Other uses of Personalization, such as placing content spots within a portlet, do not require the dynamic content features.

Disabling the dynamic content features will provide a modest performance benefit. It will provide a reduction in the memory needed for each user and also will reduce the processing time for generating pages in HCL Portal. For example, in one measurement with our base Portal scenario, capacity improved about 5% when disabling the dynamic content support.
