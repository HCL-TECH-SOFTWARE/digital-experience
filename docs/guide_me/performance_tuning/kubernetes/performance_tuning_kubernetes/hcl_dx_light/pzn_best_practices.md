# Personalization Best Practices

HCL Portal Personalization lets you choose content for users, based on information in their profiles and on business rules. More information about Personalization is available in the Portal Information Center, under the topic “Personalizing your content”.

If your site is using Personalization, you’ll want to make sure you’re getting the best possible performance as well. Performance information is presented in [Publishing considerations](../../../../../manage_content/pzn/publishing_pzn_rules/pzn_publish_considerations.md).
