# Personalization Best Practices

**HCL Portal Personalization** lets you choose content for users based on their profiles and business rules.  
More information is available in the Portal Information Center under the topic [Personalization of content](../../../../../manage_content/pzn/pzn_intro.md#personalization-of-content).

If your site is using Personalization, ensure you're also optimizing for performance.  
Details are covered in [Publishing considerations](../../../../../manage_content/pzn/publishing_pzn_rules/pzn_publish_considerations.md).
