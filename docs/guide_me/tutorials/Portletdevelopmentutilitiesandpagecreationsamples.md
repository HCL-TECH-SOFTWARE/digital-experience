# Portlet development utilities and page creation samples on HCL GitHub

With the samples provided on the [HCL Github repositories](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dx-portlet-development-utilities), developers can access a new repository of Portlet Development Utilities to automate creating pages and pages from templates. Developers also have the option to deploy through DXClient. The git repository also contains samples using the DX Java API as a custom maven archetype to create a new JSR286 portlet that can also be deployed using DXClient.
