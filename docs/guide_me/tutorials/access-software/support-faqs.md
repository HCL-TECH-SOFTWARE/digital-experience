### I do not believe I received a password reset email for the HCL Support Portal.  How can I check?

First, check your junk mail folder to see if it was filtered to this location.  If it is not there, please check with your IT department to see if email from this sender is being blocked.  If neither option works, please call HCL Support for further assistance. For more information, see <https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010151>.

## Business Partner Support FAQs

### As a Business Partner, how do I register with HCL Software?
To register with HCL Software, access the Partner On-boarding information at the Partner Connect site.

### As a Business Partner, how do I open a case on the HCL Support Portal for all of my respective customers?
The HCL Support Ticketing System requires that there be a unique user ID for each customer account that you manage. You may obtain the user ID by using either of the following two methods:

Self-register via the Support Portal with a unique User ID for each client's HCL Customer Number (HCN) that you need to manage.
Directly request that the customer admin add you as a contact on the account.

Once you obtain the user ID for the customer account, follow these instructions to open a case.

HCL is currently working on a solution to streamline this process by allowing Business Partners to view all cases for various customers you support via a single User ID.  Once this solution is available, HCL will provide a communication with more details.

### How do I view cases for my respective customers?
Once you log in with the User ID associated with the customer account, you will only be able to view cases that you have opened.  If you wish to see all cases that have been opened by any named caller under this customer account, your User ID will need to be granted Admin access.  If you do not have the Admin role, please contact the customer Admin and request to be added as an administrator on the customer account.  Keep in mind that until a solution is provided to allow for a single user ID to view multiple customer accounts, you will need to perform this step for all customer account User IDs where you need admin access.

### How do I reopen cases?
If you need to reopen a case, contact the Customer Assistance Center (CAC) who will assist with reopening the case. For more information, see
<https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010151>.

### How can a Business Partner become an Admin for a customer’s account?
For a Business Partner to become an admin for a customer’s account, the Business Partner should contact the Customer Account Admin to request this access.  The Customer account admin will be able to set the business partner up as an administrator on the account.

### How can a customer admin provide a Business Partner with admin access to the customer account?
Please see [How to create a contact](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010342#create_contact) which contains instructions on granting a user the customer_admin role.

### What roles can be assigned to contacts within a customer account?
The following roles may be assigned to a contact within a customer account:

* **sn.customerservice.customer** - A customer role for researching questions, issues, or problems. Customers can create cases and view and edit existing cases for their own accounts. They can also view a list of assets belonging to their accounts.
* **sn_customerservice.customer_admin** - An administrator role for a customer account. This user has access to all the data within the account and can create and manage contacts. This role can view all cases on the account.

### How will HCL provide hotfixes and/or other fixes that are built upon request or as a part of case resolution?
HCL Support will provide instructions or a download link via the Case record to the location of any fix that needs to be provided to resolve an issue.

### Where do I access and download the software that I am entitled to?  
Access the Licensing and Download site to obtain software product downloads.

### I have more Business Partner related questions. Where can I go for help?
For more information, please access the Business Partner FAQs and Business Partner Resources on the Partner Connect site.

## Articles & Technotes

### What is an article?
Answer: An article, also called technote, technical note, or technical notice, is a writing on a specific narrowly focused topic. There are several types of articles, for example How To, Troubleshooting, Question/Answer, or Defect article.

### How do I find articles for my product?
To find an article on a specific topic, from the home page, use the How can we help? search box to enter a keyword to return a list of articles containing that keyword. For example search for ‘phone’ to find the article listing the Support phone numbers.   Or click on the Knowledge link to be directed to a listing of all articles.  To filter the list by product, click on a product in the Category section.

### Are IBM technotes transferred to HCL?
Yes, the IBM technotes for all products that HCL acquired from IBM have been transferred to HCL. A number of HCL articles are already published and available at the Knowledge page of the HCL Customer Support portal. As HCL completes that transfer and updates of the IBM technotes, more HCL articles will become available

### How to find corresponding articles using IBM technote number
Answer: If you have an IBM technote number, you can find the corresponding article by searching at the Knowledge page. For example, if you have an IBM technote number #1966748, search the HCL site for '1966748' or 'swg21966748' to find the corresponding article. Note, if you can not find the article, the article most likely is still in the transition process from IBM to HCL

### How do I capture or copy the link to an HCL Knowledge Article?
To copy the link to the article, use the Copy Permalink button at the bottom left of the article. The link is copied to the clipboard.
