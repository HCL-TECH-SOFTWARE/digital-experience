# How to remove state information from the URL

## Applies to

> HCL Digital Experience 8.5 and higher

## Introduction

In HCL Digital Experience (DX), state information is generated by default when accessing any Portal page. When a Portal page is requested by a web browser, a URL may look like the following example:  

``` URL
https://myportal.com:10041/wps/portal/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziDVCAo4FTkJGTsYGBu7OJfjhYgbmHi7u7oYFhgL-bu4VBoJmrt7e_UaCBSbCxfhQx-vEowNSPrBCoPwqsxDTQ0t3DyMTI393M0QXoAncPS0eDAAMDCwOoAjxmFOSGRhhkOioCABL0w14!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/
```

The text after `/portal` in the URL is a generated encoded string from the Portal Server that includes the state information of a page (state of portlets, pages, and so on). There may be instances where such an encoded string should not be displayed to end-users. This document provides instructions on how you can remove such state information from the URL.

## Instructions

To remove state information from URLs, refer to the following options:

### **Option 1:** Configure Portal properties

There are three WP Config Service resource provider properties that might have an influence to the URL state generation, which are:  

- `stateless.urls.enabled`  
- `generate.stateless.urls`  
- `friendly.redirect.enabled`  

The properties can be set in the IBM Integrated Solutions Console (WAS admin console) when navigating to:  
`Resources > Resources Environment > Resource Environment Providers > WP Config Service > custom properties`  

To remove the state information in HCL DX it is suggested to set the values of that properties as following:  

- `stateless.urls.enabled=true`  
- `generate.stateless.urls=true`  
- `friendly.redirect.enabled=false`  

For more information, refer to [Configuration Service](../../../deployment/manage/config_portal_behavior/service_config_properties/portal_svc_cfg/cfg_svc/index.md) and [Defining friendly URLs without state information for pages in your site](../../../deployment/manage/siteurl_cfg/changing_siteurl/cw_navstate/mp_friendly_short_url.md).
  
### **Option 2:** Edit the HTML `<a>` tag from stateful Portal URLs

In some situations, the URL state information is still shown to end-users when they request a page or navigate to other Portal pages. This commonly happens when a Portal theme uses the [urlGeneration API](../../../build_sites/themes_skins/customizing_theme/expression_language_beans/common_beans/url_generation/index.md) to create stateful Portal URLs. In such cases, you may need a theme-code review or change to disable the URL state-information.

For example, when a theme generates a link with the following code:  
`<a href="${fn:escapeXml(node.urlGeneration.autoNavigationalState.clearScreenTemplate)}`  
and a user clicks that generated link, state information is still displayed.

It is possible to remove the state information by changing the HTML `<a>` tag to use:  
`<a href="${fn:escapeXml(node.urlGeneration.noNavigationalState)}"`
