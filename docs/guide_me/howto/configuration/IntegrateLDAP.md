# How to integrate HCL Digital Experience with LDAP (Guide)

## Applies to

## Introduction

In most organizations, different groups administer HCL Digital Experience and the LDAP server. Integrating the two requires in-depth knowledge of both systems. This document guides HCL Digital Experience administrators on obtaining the necessary information to integrate HCL Digital Experience with existing LDAP servers.
