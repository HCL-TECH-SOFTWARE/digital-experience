# Container resource management

The default Helm values included in the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Helm Chart offer minimal supported configuration for CPU and Memory resources. You can adjust the values in the `custom-values.yaml` for a deployment according to the [Kubernetes Resource Management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

```yaml
# Resource allocation settings, definition per pod
# Use number + unit, e.g. 1500m for CPU or 1500M for Memory
# The limits can be set to null explicitly to not limit the resources. Cluster and namespace level resource limits will still apply.

## Unlimited resource `limits`

All `limits` are explicitly set to `null` to unset them in Kubernetes and allow for unlimited resources depending on the Kubernetes Cluster. Cluster and namespace level resource limits still apply.

The `limits` are removed individually for either CPU or Memory. For example, to remove the Core CPU limit set the following:

```yaml
resources:
  core:
    limits:
      cpu: null
      memory: "6144Mi"
```

To remove the `limits` entirely for an application, set the following:

```yaml
resources:
  core:
    limits: null
```
