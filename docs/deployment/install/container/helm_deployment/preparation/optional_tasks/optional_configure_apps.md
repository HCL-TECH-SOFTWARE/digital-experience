# Configure Applications

## Core

### Supported LDAP configuration

You can specify a LDAP configuration that can be used by HCL Digital Experience (DX) 9.5.

The Helm chart provides a `ldap` section under the `configuration` and `core` section. This section can be used to configure a `none`, `dx` or `other` LDAP. This defaults to `none`, so there is no LDAP configured.

If you adjust this to `other`, you can configure an external LDAP that you want to connect to. Core is then configured to use this LDAP.

Currently, the configuration capability is quite limited. For more complex configurations, use the ConfigWizard instead.

**Example Configuration**

You can use the following syntax in your `custom-values.yaml` file to adjust LDAP settings:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Core
  core:
    # Settings for LDAP configuration
    ldap:
      # Determines which type of LDAP to use
      # Accepts: "none", "dx" or "other"
      # "none" - no LDAP configuration
      # "dx" - use DX openLDAP and configure it
      # "other" - use provided configuration for other LDAP
      type: "none"
      # User used to connect to LDAP, only used if ldap type is "other"
      bindUser: ""
      # Password used to connect to LDAP, only used if ldap type is "other"
      bindPassword: ""
      # Suffix in LDAP, only used if ldap type is "other"
      suffix: ""
      # Host of LDAP, only used if ldap type is "other"
      host: ""
      # Port of LDAP, only used if ldap type is "other"
      port: 
      # Supported LDAP Server types - CUSTOM
      serverType: "CUSTOM"
      # LDAP configuration id
      id: "dx_ldap"
      # Mapping attributes between LDAP and DX, LDAP attribute names (array of elements)
      attributeMappingLdap: 
        - "mail"
        - "title"
        - "userPassword"
      # Mapping attributes between LDAP and DX, DX attribute names (array of elements)
      attributeMappingPortal: 
        - "ibm-primaryEmail"
        - "ibm-jobTitle"
        - "password"
      # Non-supported LDAP attributes (array of elements)
      attributeNonSupported: 
        - "certificate"
        - "members"
```

Refer to the following Help Center documentation for more information about LDAP and Configuration Wizard configuration:

- [Configuration Wizard](../../../../../manage/portal_admin_tools/cfg_wizard/index.md)
- [Enable federated security](../../../../../manage/security/people/authentication/user_registry/cw_ldap.md)
- [Troubleshooting: Enable federated security option](../../../../../manage/troubleshooting/troubleshooting_configwizard/cw_ldap.md)

### Authoring/Rendering configuration

You can choose if the environment you deploy is configured as a WCM authoring or rendering type. This has implications on things like caching of Core.

As default, this defaults to true. The deployment is configured as an authoring environment.

If you want to adjust this to deploy a rendering environment, you can use the following syntax in your `custom-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Core
  core:
    # Settings for tuning
    tuning:
      # Configures if the environment should be configured for authoring or not
      authoring: true
```

### Expose IBM WebSphere Application Server Solution Console

Refer to the following code sample to configure the server and expose the port `10203`, which will be placed under `configuration.core.exposeConfigurationConsole`:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Core
  core:
    # Defines if the configuration console for the IBM WebSphere Application Server of Core is exposed to the network
    exposeConfigurationConsole: true
```

When `Admin Console` is enabled by setting its property to `true`, the IBM WebSphere Application Server Solution Console becomes available on port `10203`, as shown in the following example:

```url
https://yourhost:10203/ibm/console/
```

Admin Console can be disabled by setting the property to `false`.

### Configuration Wizard configuration

Although the Config Wizard is started together with the Core application by default, you can set the value to `false` to change the default behavior
If `configWizard` is set to `true`, then the Configuration Wizard, IBM WebSphere Application Server Solution Console, and DXConnect are also accessible on port `10203`.

If you want to adjust this setting, you can use the following syntax in your file:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Core
  core:
    # Settings for tuning
    tuning:
        # Configures if the server for configWizard and dxconnect is started.
      # If this is set to true, the WAS console for configWizard and dxconnect is also exposed on port 10203 at the path /ibm/console
      configWizard: true
```

### Replacing Document Conversion Services with Apache Tika

Starting from HCL DX CF205,[Document Conversion Services](../../../../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/dcs/index.md), which is used by [HCL Digital Experience Portal Search](../../../../../../build_sites/search/portal_search/index.md) and [HCL Digital Experience Remote Search](../../../../../manage/container_configuration/kubernetes_remote_search.md) is not distributed or supported by HCL. Oracle functionality is replaced by [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/){:target="_blank"}, which is included in the HCL DX CF205 and later offering. For additional information on DCS services available in CF205 and later, refer to the [Replacement of Document Conversion Services component](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0096908){:target="_blank"} knowledge article.

!!!important
    Do not change the default configuration if you do not have a backup of the Oracle DCS files in your environment. For instructions on how to backup the DCS files in a version prior to CF205, refer to [Creating a backup of DCS files](../../../../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/dcs/dcs_backup.md){:target="_blank"}.

The settings in this section are only applied during an upgrade from one CF version to another. To run the configuration manually at any other time, follow the following instructions to manually configure the deployment:

- [Replacing Document Conversion Services with Apache Tika](../../preparation/optional_tasks/optional_configure_apps.md#replacing-document-conversion-services-with-apache-tika)
- [Configure Oracle DCS](../../../../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/dcs/configuration/index.md)

|configureTika|disableStellentDCS|Result|
|---------|-----------|-------------|
|true|true|Apache Tika will be used for DX Search indexing. Oracle DCS will not be used for DX Document Conversion Services.|
|true|false|Apache Tika will be used for DX Search indexing. Oracle DCS will be used for DX Document Conversion Services.|
|false|true|Oracle DCS will be used for DX Search indexing, but will not be used for DX Document Conversion Services.|
|false|false|Oracle DCS will be used for DX Search indexing and for DX Document Conversion Services.|

By default, both parameters are set to `true` as given in the following example:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Core
  core:
    # Settings for enabling/disabling Tika
    configureTika: true 
    # Settings for enabling/disabling Stellent
    disableStellentDCS: true
```

## OpenLDAP configuration

If you choose to deploy the OpenLDAP container in your deployment, you can change country, organization and suffix, that may be configured in OpenLDAP for use.

Use the following syntax in your `custom-values.yaml` file to adjust the configuration:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Open LDAP
  openLdap:
    # Country configuration for Open LDAP
    country: "US"
    # Org configuration for Open LDAP
    org: "DX"
    # Suffix configuration for Open LDAP
    suffix: "dc=dx,dc=com"
```

!!!note
    Deployment of the OpenLDAP container in a production environment is not supported. This optional process of deploying OpenLDAP is solely intended for non-production environments to help one get started with HCL DX 9.5 container environment deployment. For production environments, use a production-quality LDAP with security hardening, firewall protection, and other security measures. For production use, Administrators can choose to deploy their organization's LDAP (and possibly mirror the contents of that enterprise LDAP back to this newly deployed LDAP) or connect to an already defined LDAP server, database, or custom user registry.

To use the OpenLDAP container in a Docker (non-Kubernetes) environment, include the following statement in the Docker run command for this image. For example:

```docker
docker run -e LOCAL=true -p 1389:1389 -p 1636:1636 -p 1666:1666 -v dx-openldap-certs:/var/dx-openldap/certs -v 
dx-openldap-slapd.d:/var/dx-openldap/etc/openldap/slapd.d -v dx-openldap-ldap:/var/dx-openldap/ldap 
--name dx_openldap hcl/dx/openldap:v1.0.0-release_20200622_1592846796
```

## Remote Search configuration

You can configure whether the Remote Search configuration through the IBM WebSphere Application Server Solution Console is exposed as an additional port on HAProxy or not. This defaults to true.

If set to true, you can access the Solution Console using:

```url
https://yourhost:9043/ibm/console
```

Use the following syntax in your `custom-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Application configuration
configuration:
  # Application specific configuration for Remote Search
  remoteSearch:
    # Should the configuration interface be exposed
    exposeConfigurationConsole: true

```
