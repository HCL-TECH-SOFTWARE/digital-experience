# Docker Compose for HCL Digital Experience 9.5

HCL Digital Experience 9.5 can be deployed for non-production purposes using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This approach streamlines deployment and configuration of HCL DX 9.5 components. For more information about Docker Compose, see the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Steps

1. Download the Docker images for the HCL DX 9.5 version you want to deploy. See [Software Download](../../get_started/download/index.md) for more information.

2. Find the HCL DX 9.5 Docker Compose scripts, along with installation and configuration instructions for non-production use, which are published as-is in Github.com in the [DX Docker Compose](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dx-docker-compose) repository. Further instructions about how to use the DX Docker Compose scripts can be found in the same repository.
