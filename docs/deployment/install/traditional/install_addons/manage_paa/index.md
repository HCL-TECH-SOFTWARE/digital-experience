When you update an existing Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file, it is not as simple as overwriting the file with the new content. There might be large differences between the content in both files. Therefore, to manage your PAA file, you can upgrade to the latest version and rollback to the previous version.

The Solution Installer provides the following tasks to manage your existing PAA files:

-   install-paa-update
-   remove-paa-update
