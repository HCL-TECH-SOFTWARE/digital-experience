# Installing add-ons

You can use the Solution Installer through the Configuration Wizard to install and uninstall add-ons to an HCL Digital Experience server instance. The Solution Installer uses the Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) format as the standard format for application distribution. Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) updates are not supported in the Configuration Wizard currently. For more information about updating add-ons using a command prompt, see the Managing your existing PAA file section.

Portal Administrators can use the Solution Installer through the Configuration Wizard to install existing PAA-formatted applications to the HCL server instance. Portal Solution Developers can use the Solution Installer through the Configuration Wizard to install PAA-formatted applications that they develop for their company.

Complete the following tasks to install, uninstall, and update add-ons.
