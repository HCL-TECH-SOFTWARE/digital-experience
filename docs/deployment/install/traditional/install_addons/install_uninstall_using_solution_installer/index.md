# Install and uninstall add-ons using the Solution Installer

As an alternative to the Configuration Wizard, you can also use the Solution Installer command line to install and uninstall add-ons.

-   **[Installing a Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file](../config/inst_paa.md)**  
After you install HCL Digital Experience, you can use the Solution Installer to install applications that are in the Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) format.
-   **[Removing a PAA assembly](../config/remove_assembly.md)**  
You must remove the installed content and resources of a Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) assembly from HCL Digital Experience. Then, you can remove the associated PAA assembly from the ConfigEngine.
-   **[Deleting PAA content after an uninstallation](../config/delete_paa.md)**  
After you run the uninstall-paa task and removing the assembly from the ConfigEngine registry, the PAA content remains in the PAA directory. To remove any remaining content, run the delete-paa command. This command inspects the PAA directory and removes content that is not registered.
