# Configuring on DX Deployment

Run the following tasks after you install and deploy HCL Digital Experience. They address tasks that are typically run one time and have a global effect. Some configuration changes are made more frequently or do not have a global effect. These tasks are addressed in the Administering section.

Review the [HCL Digital Experience Performance Tuning Guide](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0074411) to tune your stand-alone or clustered environment. Even if you have a clustered environment, review the Base Portal Tuning scenarios and the Tuning a cluster environment chapter. In addition, the tuning guide provides information about caches for HCL Digital Experience.
