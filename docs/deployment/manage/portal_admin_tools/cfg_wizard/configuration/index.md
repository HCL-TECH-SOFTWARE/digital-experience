# Configuration options in the Configuration Wizard

Using the following configuration options, you can configure the portal server that you are connected to in real time. You can also download scripts and instructions to run on other servers, create reusable scripts for common configuration patterns, and create scripts to compare to scripts created in previous releases.

## Configuration Wizard and clusters

In clustered environments, you can use the Configuration Wizard from the primary node. You can use the scripts from the primary node on the other nodes. You do not need to deploy the Configuration Wizard to the deployment manager.

## Configuration Wizard profile

The wizard has a unique profile, cw_profile, and administrator credentials.
