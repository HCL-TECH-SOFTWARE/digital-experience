# WebSphere® Integrated Solutions Console


The WebSphere® Integrated Solutions Console allows you to view and modify configuration related to the underlying J2EE functionality of HCL Digital Experience. The WebSphere® Integrated Solutions Console is also called IBM Console, WAS console, WAS Admin Console, or Websphere AdminConsole.
