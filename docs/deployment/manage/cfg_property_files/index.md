# Configuration Properties

For your convenience, the properties files that are used to configure HCL Digital Experience are included in the product documentation. Information that is specified in the properties files is used to configure databases, LDAP integration, security, including external security managers, and more.

During the configuration process, you can enter passwords and user IDs in the properties file. You can also specify them on the command line when you run the task. If you specify the information in the properties file, you can use the delete passwords task to remove the passwords.
