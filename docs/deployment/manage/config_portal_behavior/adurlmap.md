# URL mapping

URL mappings were deprecated starting with HCL Portal Version 8.5. Instead, you can now use friendly URLs or Vanity URLs as an alternative to URL mapping.

Depending on your requirements, you can use vanity URLs, or friendly URLs:

-   If you want to have a short URL as an entry point to a specific portal page or content item, use a vanity URL.
-   If you want to have a friendly URL that your site visitors see when the portal shows the page, use a friendly name.
-   If you want to be able to publish the page through the Web Content Manager workflow, use a vanity URL. For example, this URL can be useful for a marketing campaign.
-   If you want to address a specific portal page through URL generation tags or APIs, use unique name IDs. For more information, see *URL generation in HCL Portal*.

You can create both vanity URLs and friendly URLs for the same portal page.
