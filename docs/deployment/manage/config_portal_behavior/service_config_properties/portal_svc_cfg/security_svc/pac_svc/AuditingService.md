# Auditing Service 

With the Auditing Service, you can log a set of events in to a separate audit log file. All events are organized in groups. For example, the logging events User Created and User Deleted are grouped and must be turned on or off together.

In the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console, the portal Auditing Service is listed as WP AuditService.

The section about available events lists and describes the events that are available for auditing.

The audit log output is written to the audit log file. No other log messages are written to this file. For an explanation of the contents of the audit log file, refer to the section about the audit log file.

## Auditing service configuration

By default, the audit log service is disabled. Therefore, the service is loaded, but does not register any event listeners for audit logging. The auditing service configuration is controlled by the Auditing Service.

### audit.service.enable = (false)

This parameter is the global switch. Set this parameter to `true` to turn on the service. Set this parameter to `false` to turn off the service. The default setting is `false`.


Use the following property to configure the actual log file access of the service:

**audit.service.enable = (false)**

This parameter is the global switch. Set this parameter to `true` to turn on the service. Set this parameter to `false` to turn off the service. The default setting is `false`.

Use the following property to configure the actual log file access of the service:

```
audit.logFileName = log/audit_$APPSERVER_NAME_$CREATE_TIME.log
```

You can use the auditing service to have the transaction ID written to the audit log file. The project ID can also be written to the audit log file. Because these IDs can be long and might not be required in every environment, you can disable the inclusion of the IDs.

### audit.showTransactionID.enable = (true)

Use this property to disable transaction IDs in the audit log. Change the value to `false`. The default value is `true`.

### audit.projects.enable = (true)

Use this property to disable project IDs in the audit log. Change the value to `false`. The default value is `true`.
You determine the events that you want to be logged by enabling the appropriate properties as required. Set the events that you want to enable to the value `true`. The following groups of events are defined:

```
	audit.groupEvents.enable
	audit.userEvents.enable
	audit.portletEvents.enable
	audit.roleEvents.enable
	audit.roleBlockEvents.enable
	audit.ownerEvents.enable
	audit.resourceEvents.enable
	audit.externalizationEvents.enable
	audit.userInGroupEvents.enable
	audit.webModuleEvents.enable
	audit.domainAdminDataEvents.enable
	audit.designerDeployServiceEvents.enable
	audit.impersonationEvents.enable 
	audit.taggingEvents.enable
	audit.ratingEvents.enable
	audit.projectPublishEvents.enable
	audit.vanityURLEvents.enable

```

The default value for all of these properties is `false`. That means that no events are logged by default, even if you turned on the service by setting the property audit.service.enable to `true`.

To enable one or more groups of events, change the default value of the appropriate **audit.eventGroup.enable** property to `true`.

## Available events
This list shows the events that you can log with the auditing service. They are listed by the groups in which they are available. If you enable one group, all events in that group are logged.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>audit.roleBlockEvents</code></td>
<td>Role block modified event</td>
<td>The portal role block information of a resource was changed. The event message contains a list of blocked and non-blocked roles on the resource. As roles can either be inherited or propagated, two separate lists exist for inheriting roles and propagating roles. If the propagation of role blocks was changed, the list for inheriting roles is empty and vice versa.</td>

## Audit log file
The audit log file contains one audit log message per line. All log messages start with a time stamp, followed by the optional transaction ID, the message code, and the event message. Each event message contains the following information:

- The user ID of the user who triggered the audit event
- Additional information about the event itself

Events for actions that run in a transaction are written to the log file when the transaction is committed. If the transaction is rolled back, no event messages are written to the log file.

Events for actions that do not run in a transaction are written to the log immediately. In such cases, the related action is not always completed successfully.
