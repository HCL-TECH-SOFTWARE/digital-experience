title: Adding a vault segment
---




You can create a vault segment as a way to group vault slots. A vault segment can also be created when a portlet requires access to a secure resource for which a vault segment is not defined.

1.  Select a credential vault from the **Vaults** menu. The selection list for resources reflects the resources that are already defined for that vault.

2.  Type a **Vault segment name**. The name must be fewer than 255 characters and cannot include the pipe character.

3.  Type a **Vault segment description**. The description must be fewer than 255 characters.

4.  Click **OK** to save the changes or click **Cancel** to discard the changes. A task success or failure message appears.
