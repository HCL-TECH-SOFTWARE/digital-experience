# Configuring the rule-based user groups adapter

To install rule-based user groups on your HCL Portal, you must set up a database, and configure VMM rule based groups.

-   **[Database setup](../cfg_rule_based_user_groups/rbug_db_setup.md)**  
You must create the database table manually before you can use rule based user groups.
-   **[Database source configuration](../cfg_rule_based_user_groups/rbug_dsrc_cfg.md)**  
The rule-based user groups adapter uses a Java data source to communicate with the database that holds the table for the rule-based groups.
-   **[Configuring the VMM rule-based groups repository](../cfg_rule_based_user_groups/cfg_vmm_rule_based_groups_repo)**  
To enable the VMM rule-based groups repository adapter, modify several VMM configuration files.
