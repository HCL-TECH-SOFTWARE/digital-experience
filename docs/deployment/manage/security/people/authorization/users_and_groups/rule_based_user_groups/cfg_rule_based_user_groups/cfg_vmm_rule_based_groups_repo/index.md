# Configuring the VMM rule-based groups repository

To enable the VMM rule-based groups repository adapter, modify several VMM configuration files.

In a cluster, you can change the configuration files directly on the deployment manager and then synchronize the changes to all cluster nodes.

-   **[Configuring the VMM repository and realm](../cfg_vmm_rule_based_groups_repo/rbug_cfg_vmm_rps_rlm.md)**  
Run the wp-create-cur, wp-create-cur-custom-property, and wp-update-group-repository-relationship commands to configure the VMM repository and realm.
-   **[Configuring the rule attribute for the Group](../cfg_vmm_rule_based_groups_repo/rbug_cfg_vmm_attrb.md)**  
In addition to the repository configuration, you must define the rule attribute as a new attribute for the entity type Group.
