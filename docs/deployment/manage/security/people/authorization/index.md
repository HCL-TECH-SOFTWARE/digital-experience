# Authorization

Authorization ensures that a particular user (or computer system) has the right to carry out a certain activity.

-   **[Users and groups](../authorization/users_and_groups/)**  
HCL Digital Experience offers you centralized administration of users and user groups, allowing you to better define users and manage user access rights.
-   **[Controlling access](../authorization/controlling_access/)**  
After creating users and groups, you can assign them different levels of access to specific resources, roles, and policies. This access controls what actions they can perform on various pages, portlets, and applications.
-   **[Enabling Attribute Based Security](../authorization/enable_abs.md)**  
Attribute based security for HCL Web Content Manager content is an access filter in the product filter chain. You can extend the access control permission checks for HCL Web Content Manager content beyond the user or group-based decisions.
