title: Changing the authentication level
---




The authentication level only applies to page and portlet resource types. By default, the authentication level is set to standard but you may want all identified users to view information without having to log in or you may want users to log in and authenticate before viewing certain pages and portlets.

Perform the following steps to change the authentication level:

1.  Click either the **Pages** or **Portlets** resource type.

2.  Click the **Authentication level** link for the required page or portlet.

3.  Choose one of the following authentication level radio buttons:

    -   **Standard**: Default and context-related authentication level
    -   **Identified**: User authentication using a persistent HTTP cookie
    -   **Authenticated**: User authentication using user name and password
4.  Click **OK** to save your changes.
