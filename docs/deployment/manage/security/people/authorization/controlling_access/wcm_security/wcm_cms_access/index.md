# Users, Groups and Roles

You need to create a different group for each type of user and then assign those groups different roles within your content management system.

-   **[Web content management roles](../wcm_cms_access/wcm_cms_roles.md)**  
You define the access of a user or group for a library to determine who has access to a library, and to define access to the different views within the authoring portlet.
-   **[User roles and access](../wcm_cms_access/wcm_security_items.md)**  
Different users will have different access to items and functions in your system depending on the role they are assigned. Roles can be assigned at the library level, and also assigned on individual items.
-   **[Security architecture](../wcm_cms_access/wcm_cms_security_architecture.md)**  
The security architecture describes what groups are required for your site and what access is required for different groups to the authoring portlet and rendered website.
