# Setting resource permissions

Assign and control access for different types of resources.

The Resource Permissions portlet allows you to:

-   Control whether or not a resource propagates or inherits its role assignments through the resource hierarchy
-   Assign roles explicitly to specific users and groups
-   Place resources under the control of an external security manager or bring back externalized resources under the control of HCL Digital Experience
-   Create or delete roles on externalized resources
-   View inherited role assignments for specific users and groups

See the Resource Permissions portlet help for detailed instructions on setting resource permissions.

Access the Resource Permissions portlet from the administration menu. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Access** \> **Resource Permissions**. From there, you select the resource type that you want to work with, an example is Pages. An **Assign Access** icon is available for each page listed.
