# Removing members from a group


Learn how to remove a member \(a user or user group\), from a user group.

A member can be a user or a user group. Removing members from a group does not delete them from HCL Portal.

Perform these steps to remove a member from a user group:

1.  Search for the required user group or click the **All Portal User Groups** link to get a list of groups.

2.  Select the required user group.

3.  Click the **Remove** icon for the user or group that you want to remove from the group. A dialog box warns that the selected user or group will be removed from this group.

4.  Click **OK** to save your changes, or **Cancel** to exit without saving your changes.

    **Note:** You can also use XMLAccess to remove multiple members from one group at one time. Contact your administrator for information about using XMLAccess to remove multiple users.
