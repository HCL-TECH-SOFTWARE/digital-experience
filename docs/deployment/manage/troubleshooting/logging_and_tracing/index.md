# Logging and tracing

If you are experiencing a problem, you might want to enable tracing and then re-create the problem to capture more log information.

Refer to the MustGather data collection lists used in troubleshooting various problems in HCL Portal and HCL Web Content Manager. Collecting MustGather data early, even before you open a PMR, helps HCL Software Support quickly determine whether:

-   Symptoms match known problems \(rediscovery\).
-   A non-defect problem can be identified and resolved.
-   A defect identifies a workaround to reduce severity.
-   Locating the root cause can speed development of a code fix.

You can enable logging and tracing for software that is included with HCL Digital Experience. Enabling tracing makes log output more verbose. For example, you can enable tracing within WebSphere® Application Server to obtain information about application servers and other processes.

You can use the information gathered to help solve your own problems or to report an issue to HCL Software Support.
