# HCL Portal runtime logs

If tracing is enabled, HCL Digital Experience generates a log file during run time that contains messages and trace information.

The default runtime log file is shown:

-   AIX® and Linux™: wp_profile_root/logs/WebSphere_Portal/trace.log
-   Windows™: wp_profile_root\logs\WebSphere_Portal\trace.log

See the topic on system event logging for details on how to configure logging and for information on the grammar of the "trace string" configuration key.

The following information describes trace loggers for particular situations and problem symptoms. Enabling the trace loggers can slow down HCL Portal.

!!!note
    If there are problems with portal administration portlets, the error is not caused by the portlet code itself, but by the underlying function for which the portlet provides the UI. Therefore, the portlet trace strings are not listed here. If there are issues with these portlets, provide the trace strings of the underlying function. If you need traces or logs for portlets, you can learn how to obtain them from support personnel.

## Access Control

-   **When to use**

    Enable this tracer if you want permissions for resources to be explained in detail, need to verify the correctness of a permission, or need to isolate a defect in access control.


-   **Trace String**

    ```
    com.ibm.wps.ac.*=all
    ```

-   **Additional comments**

    The traces are easier to evaluate while HCL Portal usage is low.

    **Important:** Enabling this logger creates large log files.


## Authentication

-   **Trace String**

    ```
    com.ibm.wps.services.puma.*=all:   
    com.ibm.wps.puma.*=all:  
    com.ibm.wps.auth.*=all: 
    com.ibm.wps.sso.*=all: 
    com.ibm.wps.um.*=all: 
    com.ibm.wps.services.authentication.*=all
    ```
