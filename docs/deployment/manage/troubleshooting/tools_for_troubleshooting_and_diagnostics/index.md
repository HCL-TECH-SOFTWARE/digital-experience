# Troubleshooting and diagnostics tools

A number of tools and resources are available to help you troubleshoot issues and resolve problems while using HCL Digital Experience.

If you need further assistance, you can use the tools described here to identify and collect information to help HCL Software Support determine the underlying cause of a problem.

-   **[Data collection and symptom analysis](../trouble/tbl_apdt_over.md)**  
There is one method to collect data and analyze symptoms for problem determination scenarios. You run a task that can collect and optionally send the data for you. Starting with HCL Digital Experience version 8.5, there is now a task to collect the configuration wizard logs. This task is only necessary if the wizard fails before the steps to create the wp\_profile/ConfigEngine instance.
-   **[Portal version and history information](../reference/wp_history.md)**  
You can use the HCL Digital Experience version and history information tools to gather information about your portal installation.
