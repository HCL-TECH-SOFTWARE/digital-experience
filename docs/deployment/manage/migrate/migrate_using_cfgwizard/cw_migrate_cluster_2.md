    !!!note
        If you are migrating from HCL Portal Enable or Portal Extend offerings to Portal Server or Web Content Management offerings, complete the following steps manually. <br> 1.  Locate the backup of the source profile. For example, in the /tmp/wp_profile_bak directory. <br> 2.  Locate the wps.properties file in this directory. For example, /tmp/wp_profile_bak/PortalServer/wps.properties. <br> 3.  Open the wps.properties file in a text editor. Modify the value of the WPFamilyName to match your 8.5 licensed offering. For example, if you were on 8.0 Enable, and you purchased 8.5 Web Content Manager, you would modify from WPFamilyName=enable to WPFamilyName=wcm. Valid values for HCL Portal 8.5 include: server, enable, extend, wcm, and wse. <br> 4.  Save changes to the wps.properties file.

7.  Manual Step: Update the deployment manager settings

    -   **Condition**

        none

        none

    -   **ConfigEngine task**

        none

9.  Create a default profile
