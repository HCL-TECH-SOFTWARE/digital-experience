# Migrate a stand-alone server

Use the Configuration Wizard to migrate a stand-alone server environment. Use the following information to get familiar with the information that you must provide in the wizard and the configuration procedure that it generates.

## Migrate a stand-alone server option

After you answer questions and provide information about your migration, the wizard generates a custom configuration procedure.

Depending on your environment, the wizard generates a configuration process. The following steps reflect all possible steps in the configuration process. The steps do not represent a literal configuration. The steps are provided as a reference.

If you click **View Step Command**, you can see the task and properties that are associated with each step in the wizard.

1.  Manual Step: Install the latest fix packs

    -   **Condition**

        none

    -   **ConfigEngine task**

        none

2.  Generate the files for remote migration

    -   **Condition**

        The target portal is on a different server than the source.

    -   **ConfigEngine task**

        none

3.  Manual Step: Copy the remote migration package to the source environment

    -   **Condition**

        The target portal is on a different server than the source.

    -   **ConfigEngine task**

        none

4.  Create a backup of the remote source portal profile

    !!!note
        If you are migrating from HCL Portal Enable or Portal Extend offerings to Portal Server or Web Content Management offerings, complete the following steps manually. <br> 1.  Locate the backup of the source profile. For example, in the /tmp/wp_profile_bak directory. <br>  2.  Locate the wps.properties file in this directory. For example, /tmp/wp_profile_bak/PortalServer/wps.properties. <br> 3.  Open the wps.properties file in a text editor. Modify the value of the WPFamilyName to match your 8.5 licensed offering. For example, if you were on 8.0 Enable, and you purchased 8.5 Web Content Manager, you would modify from WPFamilyName=enable to WPFamilyName=wcm. Valid values for HCL Portal 8.5 include: server, enable, extend, wcm, and wse. <br> 4.  Save changes to the wps.properties file.

6.  Manual Step: If the backup profile is larger than 2 GB, clean up the backup profile

    -   **Condition**

        none

    -   **ConfigEngine task**

        none

7.  Create a default profile

    **Version 7.0 Server Offering-only migration:** Do not complete the upgrade profile step using the Configuration Wizard. Instead you must run this task manually.

Please see previous messages for reasons and possible corrective actions. <br> -   EJPPH0048W: The synchronization mode of all nodes in the portal cluster is not consistently set. The portlet application PA_ContactList will not be started in the Application Server. Manual synchronization is assumed for all nodes.

To complete migration, you must perform several post-migration tasks that depend on how you use HCL Digital Experience.

1.  Review the [Migration: Next steps](../../../../deployment/manage/migrate/next_steps/index.md) section of the product documentation.
    -   Complete the [Migration: Post-migration activities](../../../../deployment/manage/migrate/next_steps/post_mig_activities/index.md) that apply to how you are using HCL Digital Experience before you move on to the next step. For example, if you are using a virtual portal, then complete the virtual portal post-migration steps.
    -   Start the [enabling new functionality](../../../../deployment/manage/migrate/next_steps/enable_func_migrated_portal/index.md) tasks only after you complete the post-migration tasks.
