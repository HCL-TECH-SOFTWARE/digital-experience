# Migrating web search collections

You migrate web search collections to HCL Digital Experience 8.5 by exporting each web search collection from the earlier portal and then importing the web search collection into the new portal. You can also use the same functionality to move web search collections to a production portal after verifying them on a test portal, or to move web search collections to a configuration with remote search after verifying them locally on a portal.
