You can also migrate from a Server install to the Enable or Extend versions of HCL Digital Experience.

!!!note "Note for Version 6.1 customers" 
    If you are currently on Version 6.1, you must perform a two-step migration from Version 6.1 to Version 8.0, and then from Version 8.0 to 8.5. Go to [Migrating from HCL Portal 6.1 to Portal 8.5](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm) for guidance on the two-step migration process.

**Important Fix Pack Requirements:** Migration is supported from the two most recent fix packs for Version 7.0.0.2 and Version 8.0.0.1. However, you must apply the latest cumulative fix to your source environment. Your target environment must also have the latest cumulative fix and the most recent fix pack applied.

If you are not sure which earlier version is installed, run the following command on the earlier portal server:

-   Windows™: wp_profile_root\PortalServer\bin\WPVersionInfo.bat
-   UNIX™Linux™: wp_profile_root/PortalServer/bin/WPVersionInfo.sh

When you migrate to 8.5, HCL Digital Experience automatically migrates the following applications and configuration data:

-   Security configuration
-   Access control
-   Portal behavior
-   Portlet applications
-   Customized portal resources, such as themes and skins, pages, and portlets
-   Personalized content
-   Virtual portals

!!!note
    You cannot upgrade the source portal with a fix pack after migration if you intend to remigrate the JCR. For example, if your source portal is Version 7.0.0.1 and you migrate it to 8.5, you cannot then upgrade the source portal to Version 7.0.0.2 and remigrate the JCR. This path is not supported.
