# Migrating from Web Content Manager version 7.0 or 8.0

These are the migration options available when migrating from Web Content Manager version 7.0.x or 8.0.x.

-   **[Planning for changes to web content when migrating from Web Content Manager version 7.0](mig_content_options_planning_7-0.md)**  
Migration projects require careful planning to synchronize changes from the old production system with the new system. Content creation can still continue on the old system while the new system is installed. A typical migration plan includes time for provisioning, configuring, testing, and tuning infrastructure and software. Custom or third-party applications require their own migration procedures.
-   **[Portlet API Web Content Viewer and Remote Web Content Viewer](mig_pre_wcm_portlets.md)**  
If you use the Web Content Viewer portlet or the Remote Web Content Viewer portlet that are based on the HCL Portlet API, then you must plan for the replacement of those portlets when migrating.
-   **[Cross version syndication](mig_content_options_cross-version.md)**  
Cross version syndication is the preferred method of refreshing web content after an initial migration. The portal migration process is used to migrate web content, however after the initial migration is complete, syndication is used to keep the migrated system synchronized with the older system.
-   **[Managed pages migration](mig_content_options_managed_pages.md)**  
When you migrate your HCL Digital Experience to Version 8.5, here are some considerations with regards to managed pages.
-   **[Library export and import and migration](mig_content_options_export.md)**  
Web content libraries can be exported from one system and imported onto another. This tool can be used as part of a migration, but there are some limitations to the use of this tool.
