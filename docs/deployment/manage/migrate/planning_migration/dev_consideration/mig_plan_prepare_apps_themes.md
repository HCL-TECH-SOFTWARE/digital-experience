# Prepare applications and themes

After the move to HCL Digital Experience 8.5, it is possible that applications and themes that depend on deprecated features will not function properly. To validate custom applications and themes, it is recommended to set up a basic stand-alone HCL Portal 8.5 server.

The benefit of setting up a basic stand-alone server for validating the custom applications and themes is that the work of preparing the applications and themes for HCL PortalVersion 8.5 can be done in parallel with migration, which can generally save time in the overall migration process.

This tactic can also be applied to any new custom applications or themes that are developed for Version 8.5. Rather than waiting for the HCL Portal 8.5 server migration to complete, you can begin development of the new applications and themes on a stand-alone server while the migration is taking place.
