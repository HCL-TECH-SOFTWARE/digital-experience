# Theme tasks

To ensure that your new environment functions properly, complete theme tasks such as updating the default theme and skin or applying themes to your pages.

-   **[Updating the default theme and skin](mig_upgrade_default_themes_skin.md)**  
You can add the Portal 8.5 theme and 8.5 skin to all new pages by default.
-   **[Applying the new theme to your Portal pages](mig_post_apply_theme.md)**  
Custom portal resources, such as themes and skins, are migrated automatically. The Portal 8.5 theme is also deployed when migration is complete. However, you must complete extra steps to apply the theme to your pages.
-   **[Enabling drag on a 7.0.0.2 migrated theme](mig_post_dnd.md)**  
The migrated 7.0.0.2 theme is not enabled with the drag metadata. Therefore, you must add the information to the theme definition.
-   **[Reinstalling the PortalTheme](mig_post_portaltheme_70.md)**  
If you migrate from Version 7.0 to Version 8.5, when you apply the latest Combined Cumulative Fix during post-migration, the PortalTheme from earlier Portal versions is removed. If your system requires this theme, then you can manually reinstall it.
