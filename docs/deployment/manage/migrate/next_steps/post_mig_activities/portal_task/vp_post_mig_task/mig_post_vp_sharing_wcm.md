# Sharing Web Content Manager libraries between Virtual Portals

When you created Web Content Manager libraries in the base portal of earlier versions of Portal, these libraries were available in the virtual portals. In Portal Version 8.0 and HCL Digital Experience 8.5, a Web Content Manager library that you create in the base portal is not available in the virtual portals.

If you have managed pages enabled and want to share a Web Content Manager library between virtual portals, use syndication to replicate the library to the virtual portals.
