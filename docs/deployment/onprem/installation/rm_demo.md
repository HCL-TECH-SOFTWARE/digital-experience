# HCL Digital Experience roadmap: Demonstration environment

Ideal for running product, feature, and application demos. After installation, you have an Apache Derby database and a default file-based repository.

**Parent topic:**[HCL Digital Experience roadmaps for stand-alone servers](../install/rm_standalone_parent.md)

# Who should use this roadmap

Use this roadmap if you are an organization with the following requirements:

-   An organization that needs to explore new features or functions.
-   An organization that needs to demonstrate HCL Portal to customers, clients, or colleagues.
-   An organization that needs an environment to demonstrate applications and designs.
-   If you need to demonstrate a specific database or user registry, use the Stand-alone server roadmap

# Topology diagram

A demonstration environment is a portal server with a local database. Since Apache Derby is installed, configured, and ready for use, a database is not included in the topology diagram.

# Installing the HCL Digital Experience

Installing HCL Digital Experience involves preparing your operating system, installing or upgrading the installation manager, and running the installation program. Visit *Installing the HCL Digital Experience software* for more topic information.

# Applying the latest cumulative fix

Portal maintenance is delivered through individual fixes \(Fixes\) and Combined Cumulative Fixes \(CFs\), which is recommended to your environment.

# Tuning the servers in your environment

Tuning the servers is important to the performance of your portal environment. HCL Portal is not tuned for a production environment after installation and deployment. Your database needs tuning for improved performance. You can organize your database now or soon after you finish your configuration. You need to tune and maintain your database on a regular basis.

-   Run the performance tuning tool to complete an initial tuning of your servers.
