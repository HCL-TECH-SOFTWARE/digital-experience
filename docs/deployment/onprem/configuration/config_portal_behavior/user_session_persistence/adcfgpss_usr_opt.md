# User option during login

Depending on the configuration defined by the administrator, the user can choose whether to resume the last session or not.

If the portal administrator has enabled the resume option for users, the login page displays a check box **Resume last session**. If the user selects this check box, the previous session is resumed. Otherwise the previous session is not resumed and the user starts as if logging in for the first time. The options that administrators can set are described in the following sections.
