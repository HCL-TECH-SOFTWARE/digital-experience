# Deprecated features

Review the features that were available in previous versions of HCL Digital Experience but are no longer available.

After a migration, features that are no longer supported or are deprecated might result in unpredictable behavior. Remove unsupported and deprecated features before you start your migration. As they become available, links to more information are provided to help you move away from deprecated features. For more information on which features are deprecated for Version 8.5, see [Unsupported and deprecated features for V8.5 and V9.0](../reference/intr_depc.md).
