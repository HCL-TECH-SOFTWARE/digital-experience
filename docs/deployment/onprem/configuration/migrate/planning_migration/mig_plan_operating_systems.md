# Operating systems considerations

There might be cases where you upgrade not just to a newer version of HCL Digital Experience but also to a different operating system version. In that case, there might be a different set of system requirements and considerations to keep in mind.

**Important:** Migrating between platforms \(for example, migrating from Windows™ to Linux™\) is not supported.

Use the following list as a starting point.

-   Review the supported migration paths.
-   Review the system requirements for your new environment to make sure that you are migrating to a fully supported environment.
-   Ensure that you applied all necessary fixes in preparation for migration.
-   Get a complete understanding of the differences between the source and target environments. The following questions will help you get started.
    -   Overall system administration. Are there any monitoring or administering tools in use today that might not work on the new environment?
    -   Operating system security. Is there any security polices in effect that would require being ported to the new environment?
    -   Will HCL Digital Experience security implementation be any different?
    -   File system. Will the files be placed in a different directory structure? Will those files require special permissions to run?
