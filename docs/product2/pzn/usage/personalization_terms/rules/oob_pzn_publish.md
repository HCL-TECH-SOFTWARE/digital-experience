You can publish selected rules or the full workspaces from the personalization navigator. Before you publish, you must define the publishing server.

Publishing moves the rules from the server where they were created to the live server. The personalization navigator is on the Business Rules page.

1.  Set up the publish server.
2.  On the personalization navigator, click **New** \> **Publish Server**.

3.  Update the **Publish Servlet URL** field. Change the <host\> and <port\> to match the live server.

4.  Publish rules.
5.  To publish a selected rule, select the rule in the navigator.

6.  Click **Extra Actions** \> **Publish** \> **Publish Selected**.
