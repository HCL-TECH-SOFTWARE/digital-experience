# Defining the skin and assigning it to a theme using Manage properties

When you create new skin resources, you can define them so that you can assign them to a theme.

You can define the skin and assign it to a theme by using **Manage properties** or manually. Learn more about [Defining the skin and assigning it to a theme manually.](themeopt_scopedskin_manual.md#)

1.  In the Theme Manager, select your custom theme and click **Manage properties**.

2.  Click the **Skins** tab. Then, click **Add skin**.

3.  Enter a title for your new skin. You can also set and modify other skin properties in the **Localization**, **Metadata**, and **Advanced** tabs.

4.  In the **Advanced** pane for the skin, ensure that the static content root matches the path to the directory that contains the skin in WebDAV.

5.  Click **Done**.
