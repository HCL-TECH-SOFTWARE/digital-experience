# The Bookmarks Summary portlet

The IBM® Connections Bookmarks Summary portlet gives you a targeted view of your bookmarks from within IBM WebSphere® Portal.

## Using the Bookmarks Summary portlet

Use the Bookmarks Summary portlet to integrate a specific view of Bookmarks into a Portal application. The portlet has three views:

-   **Public Bookmarks** lists all public bookmarks. This is the only view where you can filter the bookmarks by pinning a tag.
-   **Most Popular Bookmarks** lists the web pages most frequently bookmarked.
-   **Most Visited Bookmarks** lists the bookmarks that receive the most clicks.

## Editing the shared settings for the Bookmarks portlet

You must have at least editor access for the page and for the portlet to be able to edit shared settings for Connections features. For more information about access levels, see the WebSphere Portal product wiki. Settings that you enter on this page can be overridden by settings on the **Personalize** page for a portlet. Choose**Edit Shared Settings** from the portlet menu and choose which view to display in the portlet.
