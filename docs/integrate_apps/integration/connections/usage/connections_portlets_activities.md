# The Activities portlet

With the Activities portlet, you can view and create activities, and work with to do items.

## Using the Activities portlet

Use the Activities portlet to interact with the IBM® Connections Activities features. Use activities to organize your collaborative work without leaving your IBM WebSphere® Portal environment.

The Activities Detail portlet has two views, **My Activities** and **To Dos List**.

The **My Activities** view displays activities that you created or that you belong to. From the **My Activities** view you can:

-   Click **Start an Activity** to create an activity. Assign it a title and optionally enter a description, goal, or tags. Add members for your activity and save it to add it to your list.
-   Click **Completed** to view completed activities.
-   Click **High priority** to view activities that are flagged as needing your immediate attention.
-   Click **Medium priority** to view activities that are not as pressing.
-   Sort the view by clicking the column header for **Last Updated** or by **Due Date**.

Click an activity name to open it. From the activity, you can:

-   Click **Add to do item** to create a to-do item. You can assign it to yourself or to another user. You can also optionally assign a priority, due date, tags, and a description.
-   Click **Add Entry** to add an entry to the activity.
-   Click **Add Section** to create a section to keep your activity organized.
-   Respond to a to-do item by marking it complete, or click **More** to add a comment, edit, or delete the to-do item.
-   If you are the activity owner, click **Members** to add members to the activity. You can assign a member owner, author, or reader access.
-   View emails and chat transcripts that are saved to the activity. Comment on this content or create associated to do items.
