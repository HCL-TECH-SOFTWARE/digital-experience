# Process integration

Use the Unified Task List portlet to integrate with business process solutions such as IBM Process Server, WebSphere Lombardi Edition, and other enterprise resource planning software.

## Service-oriented architecture

For greater flexibility, the Unified Task List portlet retrieves data from the configured enterprise resource planning software. Then, the retrieved data is presented in the portal. The Unified Task List portlet can retrieve data from multiple enterprise resource planning systems and render the result in a cohesive user interface.

## Developer resources

The Unified Task List portlet was developed by using Web Experience Factory. You can use Web Experience Factory builders to develop actions, customize the Unified Task List portlet, and develop custom forms.
