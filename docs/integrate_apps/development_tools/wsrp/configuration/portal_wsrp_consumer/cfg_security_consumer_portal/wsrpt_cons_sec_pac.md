# Enabling Portal Access Control for a WSRP Consumer portal

You can configure Portal Access Control for the remote portlets that you consume on your Consumer portal.

When you consume portlets from a Producer portal in your Consumer portal, these remote portlets behave just like local portlets in your portal. You can assign access permissions to users on these portlets by using Portal Access Control.
