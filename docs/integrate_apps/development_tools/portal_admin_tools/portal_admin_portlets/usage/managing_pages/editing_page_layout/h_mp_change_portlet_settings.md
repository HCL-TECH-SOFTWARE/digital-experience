You can change the settings of each portlet listed in the Edit Layout portlet. These options are available from the drop-down menu on each portlet shown in the container.

Each of these options opens a new window for changing your settings for the portlet. Depending on your access privileges, some of these options may not be available to you.

-   Select **Personalize this portlet** to personalize a portlet. The updates you make here will only change the look of the portlet for you.

-   Select **Edit shared settings** for this portlet to change the default look of a portlet for all users. The updates you make here will affect all users who view the portlet on a particular page. The changes will not be reflected on any instances of the portlet that appear on other pages.

-   Select **Configure** to change the default look of a portlet for all users across all pages. The updates you make here will affect all users who view the portlet on any page.


The following settings can be changed:

-   **Users can switch page layout**

    Select this option to allow changing the layout of the page to one of these pre-defined layout templates. You can further customize this option by selecting one of the Allowed layouts.

-   **Show toggle link**

    Select this option to display the link for advanced layout tools. When this link is first clicked, tools are displayed that allow you to create advanced page layouts.

-   **Check portlet width before adding or moving portlets to a column**

    Select this option to prevent portlets of a certain width from being moved or added to a container that is too narrow.

-   **Number of items per page**

    After the search results are returned, this limits the number of portlets for each page. For multiple pages, you can use the arrow icons to navigate to the other pages.

-   **Never show more than this number of items**

    Limits the number of portlets returned in the search.

-   **Also display the following information in the search results**

    Select whether the markups supported by each portlet should also be displayed in the results.
