Objects such as portlets and containers can be rearranged on the page.

Use the appropriate arrows to move portlets and containers to the location you want. If the page manager has locked a column or row container or the content of a container, modifications to the page may be limited. Icons representing tasks that have been restricted are not displayed.

You can create columns and rows and place portlets within these containers and rearrange the containers on the page.

Selecting **Show layout tools** provides more options for moving objects on the page. For example, you can place a check by multiple portlets and click the move portlets icon to move the selected portlets to a new location.
