title: Changing portlet appearance
---




The Appearance portlet lets you change the skin of a portlet on the page. Changing the portlet skin changes the look of the area surrounding the portlet, including the border, margins, and title bar.

You can select from a list of skins that are associated with the theme for the page. Themes define the look and feel of a portal page and each theme has a list of skins associated with it. To change the skin for a portlet, perform the following steps:

1.  For each portlet, select a skin from the drop-down list.

2.  Click the Preview icon to display the selected skin. You can preview all of the skins available in the list before saving your changes.

3.  When you are finished making your selections, click **Done** to save your changes. You will return to the page from which you first accessed the Appearance portlet.
