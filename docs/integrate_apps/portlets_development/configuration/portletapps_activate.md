# Activating and deactivating portlet applications or portlets

By default, portlet applications and portlets are set to an active state after installation. You can deactivate a resource to prevent users from accessing it without changing their user roles. When a portlet application or portlet is in the active state, portal users with appropriate access can include it on their personal pages and customize it. Users that have active references to those inactive portlets on a portal page will see a message stating that the portlet is temporarily disabled.

You can toggle portlet application or portlet states to active or inactive by using the portal XML configuration interface.
