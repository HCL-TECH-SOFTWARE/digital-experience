# Task Provider Instance Registry 

The Task Provider Instance Registry \(TPIR\) contains task provider instance configurations. A task provider instance configuration contains a set of parameters that are required to connect to a back-end system. It also contains a unique ID to map the parameters to the appropriate task provider. The Task Provider Instance Registry service is in IBM WebSphere Application Server and stores the task provider configurations in an XML variable. The Task Provider Instance Registry service also provides a service to get and modify task provider instances.
