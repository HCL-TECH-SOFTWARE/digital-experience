# Task handler 

Task handlers define what the Unified Task List portlet does when users select a task to advance a workflow. The task handlers determine how the Unified Task List portlet connects to the tasks that the users must complete.

Front-end developers can customize the Unified Task List portlet in Web Experience Factory if you want to provide functions for completing tasks. For example, if there is a task to approve or deny a request in a Human Resources workflow, you can use Web Experience Factory builders to provide a simple menu with approve and deny actions.
