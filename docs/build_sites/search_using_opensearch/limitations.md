# Limitations of End-User Search with Opensearch

Take note of the following limitations when using HCL End-user Search with OpenSearch:

## Pagination

- The number of results shown per page is currently fixed at 50.

## Searchable Fields

- Only common fields such as title, description, type, and tags may be specifically searched for now. You can use the **All attributes** search parameter for a broader search range.

## Localization

- The Search user interface currently only supports the English localization.

## Accessibility

- To ensure full accessibility on the Search page, the user's browser-specific settings for keyboard navigation must be enabled.

    See the keyboard navigation setting for Firefox below.
