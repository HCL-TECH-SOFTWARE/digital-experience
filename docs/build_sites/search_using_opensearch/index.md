# HCL End-user Search with OpenSearch

The End-user Search with OpenSearch is intended to replace the existing Search with a new user interface and a new backend service using OpenSearch to provide a seamless search experience.

End-user Search with OpenSearch is for, but not limited to, the following sample use cases:

- using the new Search page right out of the box in DX once it is enabled
- adding to your new or existing theme pages the ready and functional web components we provide via Javascript and CSS modules so you can take advantage of our default styling, and at the same, override with your own stylesheet (.css files) as needed
- adding the new Java application we provide i.e. called Search V2 Portlet to a new page you created so you can have the exact same UI and functionality on your own page in another location
