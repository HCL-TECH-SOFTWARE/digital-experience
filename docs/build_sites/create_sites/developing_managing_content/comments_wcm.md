# Comments in WCM

Starting from CF213, the product contains a new solution that allows users to leave comments for Web Content Manager (WCM). These comments can be used in Intranet scenarios or in controlled settings allowing external comments. 

## WCM Comments as Custom Plugin Component

Starting from CF213, WCM Comments can be enabled as Custom Plugin Component for a WCM content. WCM Comments can be rendered on page and on the Web Content Viewerâ€‹ Portlet.

This section describes how to enable, configure, and disable the WCM commenting solution as as Custom Plugin Component for a WCM content.

### Overview

WCM Comments is a feature that allows customers to enhance their presentation template by adding in a plugin for commenting. The actual comments are also stored in WCM and can be managed like regular content. You can choose which library is being used for storing the comments.

Note that this solution is not related to the existing comments for blogs/wikis ability.

### Enabling the comments plugin in WAS Console 

To make the comments plugin visible in the plugin component tag which should be added to presentation template, you must first add the configuration in WAS Console. In WAS Console, go to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the following details:

- Name: enable.comment.plugin
- Value: true
- Type: String

!!!important
    After adding the configuration, a JVM restart is required.

### Adding Admin User Group Configuration in WAS Console for User Access Control (Optional)

By default, if the configuration for the admin user group is not present in the console, only users with manager-level access can delete comments.

For security purposes, if you need to limit the delete comments option to a specific user group, you must add the following configuration. In WAS Console, go to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the details below:

- Name: comments.admin.group
- Value: cn={user-group},o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm
- Type: String

**user-group** can be any user group such as managers, admins, editors, etc.

## Rendering WCM comments in external components

Starting from CF214, WCM comments can be rendered in external components such as Page Components and Rich Text, Script applications or Custom Portlet. For these scenarios, enabling and configuring Custom Plugin Component for WCM comments as described in the [WCM Comments as Custom Plugin Component](#wcm-comments-as-custom-plugin-component) are not required.

This section provides an overview of the page component shipped as part of CF214. It also describes how to configure WCM comments in external components such as Rich Text Editor, Script Application, and Custom Portlet.

### Custom Page Component for WCM Comments

Starting from CF214, the default WCM Comments library is shipped with a new custom page component and an additional authoring template that uses a new presentation template. This presentation template is for rendering the WCM comments HTML markup component inside the new page component.

This section provides an overview of the components related to the newly shipped page component. You can see the different components in the following images.

#### Authoring Template of Page Component

    ![Copy of new page component with content UUID](../developing_managing_content/_img/copy_new_page_component_with_contentuuid.png)

5. Save the page component. 

6. Add the highlighted code snippets in the following screenshot to any of the view files of a theme (for example, default85) where the comments feature should be enabled. In this example, navigate to ```/opt/HCL/PortalServer/theme/wp.theme.themes/default85/installedApps/DefaultTheme85.ear/DefaultTheme85.war/themes/html/dynamicSpots/``` and open the ```footer.jsp``` view file.
![WCM JSP Tags in a Theme View File](../developing_managing_content/_img/wcm_jsp_tag_theme.png)

7. Add the following code snippet in the ```footer.jsp``` view file to enable the comments for the new page component with pre-populated content UUID.

    ```
    <%@ taglib uri="/WEB-INF/tld/wcm.tld" prefix="wcm"%>
    <wcm:initworkspace>login fail</wcm:initworkspace>
    <wcm:setExplicitContext path="Custom Library/Custom Comments/Copy of New Comments" >
        Setting Explicit Context Failed
    </wcm:setExplicitContext>
    <wcm:content>
        Content Rendering Failed
    </wcm:content>
    ```
     For more information, see [Web Content Manager JSP tags](../../../manage_content/wcm_development/wcm_dev_api/wcm_reference_wcm-jsp-tags.md).
     
8. Copy the ```/wcm.ear/wcm-inplaceEdit.war/WEB-INF/tld/wcm.tld``` file from the DX core container into the TLD path of the theme to update. In this example, copy the TLD file to ```/opt/HCL/PortalServer/theme/wp.theme.themes/default85/installedApps/DefaultTheme85.ear/DefaultTheme85.war/WEB-INF/tld```.


After configuring WCM comments in a theme, actions such as add, reply, like/unlike, and delete comments can be done. The total comments count on the content item can also be viewed. In the following example, WCM comments is configured in ```footer.jsp```:
![WCM Comments in Footer Theme](../developing_managing_content/_img/wcm_comments_in_footer_theme.png)

## Access Roles and Permissions for WCM Comments

Only authorized users can view, edit, and delete the comments in the library where the comments are stored. It is required to have at least a **View** access to the WCM content library. For more information, see [Managing users and groups](../../../deployment/manage/security/people/authorization/controlling_access/managing_users_groups/index.md). 

The actions available for a user depend on their role:

- The **User** role or higher is required to see the comments.
- The **Contributor** role or higher is required to create comments.
- The **Manager** role or higher is required to delete comments. In addition to the Manager role, you can configure a specific group solely for deleting comments.

## Limitations

- Nested replies to comments are not yet supported.
- Posting and replying are limited to 500 characters. 
- Rendering Comments outside the WCM rendering process (for example, from REST or a custom Servlet or JSP via the java WCM API) is not yet supported.
- HTML tags are not rendered in the comments. If HTML tags are present, the system skips HTML tags that are added in a comment.

## Update global "Article" presentation template

If you want to perform a replacement of the OOB components that are shipped, see [Adding the sample web content libraries in the authoring portlet](../../../manage_content/wcm_delivery/deliver_webcontent_on_dx/getting_started/creating_contentsamples/wcm_delivery_ctsamples_libraries.md).

## CSRF protection for adding and deleting comments

Starting CF217, you can enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to be utilized when creating or deleting a comment to prevent possible CSRF attacks. The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled through the WAS Console. Note that a request without a valid CSRF token will fail.

To enable CSRF tokens, go to the WAS Console and navigate to to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the following details:

- Name: wcm.csrf.comments.enabled
- Value: true
- Type: String

!!!important
    After adding the configuration, a JVM restart is required.

## Cleaning up orphaned comments data stored in the library

Starting from CF214, a new API is available for soft deleting all the comments that are no longer mapped to content (for example, if the content was deleted). When you soft delete, it marks a comment as no longer active without deleting it from the database.

In the libraries query parameter, pass all the library names containing the orphaned comments data. 
The API finds all comments based on the authoring template and site area ```Comments``` of each of the defined libraries and soft deletes them. 

![Comments Library with Orphaned Comments](../developing_managing_content/_img/comments_library_orphaned_comments.png)


**Sample request:**

{{host}}/{{WpsContextRoot}}/mycontenthandler/wcmrest/deleteComments?libraries=Web Content&libraries=Demo Libraryâ€‹

**Sample response body:**

```
{
    "deletedCommentsStatus": {
        "deletedCommentsList": [
            "3346bd13-dfef-456c-bb94-ff4f829f626e",
            "e04e2e4f-2ec2-4d7a-b22d-e502eb1a80bc"
        ]
    }
}
```
