# Installed portlets



Learn about the portlets that are provided with HCL Digital Experience.

You find all portlets that are provided with the portal under the directory `[PortalServer\_root](../reference/wpsdirstr.md#portal_server_root_prod)/installableApps`. Portlets that are already deployed by the HCL installation are in the directory `[wp\_profile\_root](../reference/wpsdirstr.md#wp_profile_root)/installedApps` directory.

In addition to the portlets listed here, HCL also provides several portlets that are used for administering the portal server. You find these portlets with the Administration portlets.

<!--
**[Business portlets](bizportlet.md)**  
Business portlets are automatically installed during the HCL Portal installation. You can place and display them on a page after you install and start the portal.-->
