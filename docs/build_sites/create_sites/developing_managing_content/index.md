# Developing and managing content


Use these tools and processes to develop and manage your website.


-   **[Previewing as another user](../../../manage_content/wcm_delivery/preview_another_user/index.md)**  
You can preview changes to your website without logging out and logging on again as another user. This preview capability is used to quickly verify that users with different access levels see only content that they are authorized to see. You can preview changes as a specific user or as an unauthenticated user.
-   **[Projects](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/change_management//projects/index.md)**  
Projects are used to change a set of items on your site and ensure that they are published together at the same time. A new project has a default workflow that allows content to be reviewed and approved before it is published.
-   **[Workflow and change management](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/change_management/workflow/index.md)**  
You can manage changes to web content items either by creating drafts, by using workflows, or adding items to projects.
-   **[IBM Web Content Integrator](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/wci/index.md)**  
The Web Content Integrator is a solution for integrating externally managed web content with HCL Portal. By using standard content syndication feed technologies based on RSS 2.0, the Web Content Integrator provides a loosely coupled mechanism for transferring published content and metadata to the portal after they are approved in the source system. When the content and metadata are transferred to the portal, it is possible to use the built-in content management features of Web Content Manager to secure, personalize, and display the content to users.
-   **[WebDAV](../../../manage_content/wcm_delivery/webdav/index.md)**  
With WebDAV for HCL Digital Experience, you can use standard operating system tools to create, modify, and delete web content rather than the standard authoring portlet.
-   **[Blogs](../developing_managing_content/blogs/index.md)**  
Use blogs and blog libraries to provide news and commentary on a variety of subjects pertinent to your intranet and extranet sites. Blogs and blog libraries typically combine text with graphics and links to other blogs and web sites. Entries that you create and post are arranged in reverse-chronological order, with the newest entry displayed first. Readers can post comments about your entries, fostering discussions and online networking. You can manage your own blog entries and comment on other blog entries. You can also incorporate tagging and rating as you would with other WebSphereÂ® Portal content.
-   **[Wikis](../developing_managing_content/wikis/index.md)**  
Use wikis to share community content on a variety of subjects pertinent to your intranet and extranet sites. Wikis typically combine text with graphics and links to other wikis and web sites. You can monitor and manage your own wiki articles.
-   **[Installed portlets](intr_por.md)**  
Learn about the portlets that are provided with HCL.
-   **[Comments in WCM](comments_wcm.md)**  
Starting from CF213, the product contains a new solution enabling users to leave comments for WCM. These comments can be used in Intranet scenarios or in controlled settings allowing external comments.
-   **[Renditions](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/renditions/index.md)**  
Renditions are different versions of an image component or element. Renditions can be thumbnails or smaller versions of an image formatted for mobile devices.
-   **[Video start and end points](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/renditions/rend_cue_points.md)**  
File components or elements that have a video file that is stored in an HTML5 video format, which includes MP4, webM, or ogg, are stored in Brightcove and have a Brightcove ID.
