# Portlets for adding dynamic elements to static pages

If you want to add dynamic elements such as portal navigation to your static pages, you can use portlets that the portal provides.

HCL Digital Experience (DX) provides the following portlets for static pages. These portlets are included in a default portal installation. You can address them by using their unique names.

-   **Navigation portlet**

    The Navigation portlet adds portal navigation to a page. When writing a static portal page you can configure the starting point of the navigation and the number of navigation levels by using the initialization parameters.

-   **Breadcrumb Trail portlet**

    The Breadcrumb Trail portlet adds the path from the content root down to the currently selected static page.

-   **Page List portlet**

    The Page List portlet adds an arbitrary list of links to pages to a static page.
