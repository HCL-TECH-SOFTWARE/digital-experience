# Presentation templates

You use a presentation template define the layout of your web content. Use tags to determine which properties, elements, or components are displayed.

## Defining presentation for Web Content Viewer portlets

When you display content with HCL Portal, the presentation template defines only the layout of content that is displayed in a Web Content Viewer portlet. The overall page design is determined by which page layout is selected, which portlets are added to the page, and the selected theme.

## Defining presentation for servlet rendered content

When you display content in a servlet delivered site, the presentation template represents the entire page. The presentation template also defines the default properties of a web page such as the background and default font of a web page.

There is little difference between building a presentation template and using HTML to build a servlet delivered web page. It might even be helpful to build a "mock-up" of the page you are designing in HTML before creating a new presentation template. Then replace the different sections of your web page with references to elements and components by using web content tags.
