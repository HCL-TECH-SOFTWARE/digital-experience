You use components to store elements that are used in more than one area of your website. For example, a company logo or a copyright notice.

## Static components

Static components are used to store static content such as text, files, or images.

-   [Component Reference](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/content_management_artifacts/elements/component_reference_element/index.md): You use a component reference to store a reference to a component. To create a component reference element, you can either add a component reference element to an authoring template, site area, or content item, or create a component reference component.

To create a date and time element, you can either add a date and time element to an authoring template, site area, or content item, or create a date and time component.

## Tool components

Tool components are used to create tools that can be added to web pages for users to do tasks such as search, inline editing, and paging through pages of links.

-   [Authoring Tools](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/content_management_artifacts/elements/authoringtools_element/using_authoringtools_elements/wcm_config_wcmviewer_authcomp.md): Authoring tools elements that are rendered in a web content viewer allows you to create, read, edit, delete, approve, or reject content items directly in the web content viewer, instead of requiring you to browse to the HCL Web Content Manager authoring portlet to run the same action.

A search element cannot be used in isolation, but must be used together with an HTML element that is used to define the search query form.
