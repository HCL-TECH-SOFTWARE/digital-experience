# Editing page settings

After you create a page, modify the page settings to change the page title, create a friendly URL name, and more. To access page settings for an existing page, click the page in site manager and click the context menu icon. Then, click Open Page Settings.

When you create a page, you must create a title for that page. The friendly URL name is automatically generated based on the page title that you enter. The friendly URL name does not have to match the page title, so you can edit the friendly URL name to a value of your choosing. For more information about friendly URLs, see [Using friendly URLs](../../../../deployment/manage/portal_admin_tools/portal_user_interface/managing_pages/manage_pages_portlets/mp_friendly_url.md).

    You can search for a page by the title, for example, in the Portal Site library. However, if you choose to sort pages by title, the sorting option filters by the Unique name or Identifier of the page, and not the title that you specified in the page settings.
