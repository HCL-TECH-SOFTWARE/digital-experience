    You are responsible for managing the biographies of speakers at a conference. To have high conference attendance, visitors to the site need to know who is speaking at the conference and some general information about each speaker.

-   **Audience for content**

    This content applies to anyone that is attending the conference or is considering attending the conference.

-   **Configuration details**

    Regardless of the content settings for the page, you need the content that displays in this spot to always come from the CTC Demo/Home/Program/Speakers/Components folder in your library.

    You decide to create an index list. With this index list, you list out the names of the speakers and their summary biographies. Each summary biography contains a link that a visitor can click to view the full biography.
