# Creating new categories for the Page Component palette by using the Manage Pages portlet

Associate content with the hidden content page to define categories in the Page Component palette. This was known as the Content palette before CF08. Content items within the associated site area appear in the new category of the site toolbar.

The site area or page that you want to use as the new category must exist.

The benefit to creating new categories for the Page Component palette by using the Manage Pages portlet is that you can view all libraries. You can therefore create a category from any of the libraries that are available.

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface** \> **Manage Pages**.

2.  Select **Content Root** \> **Hidden Pages** \> **Toolbar Content Root** \> **Add**.

3.  Click **Edit Page Properties** of the Page Component palette.

4.  Open **Advanced options**.

5.  Select **I want to edit associations**.

6.  Select **Add web content**.

7.  Select the site area or page that you want to use as the new category in the Page Component palette.

8.  Click **OK**.
