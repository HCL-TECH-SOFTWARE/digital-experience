# Customizing the Page Component palette

The Page Component palette, which is accessed from the site toolbar, contains the content items a content author can add to a page. This was known as the Content palette prior to CF08.

Page Components act as templates. When added to a page, the items that comprise the Page Component are copied. Authors can adapt these items according to their needs. The top-level view of the Page Component palette contains categories. To find a certain Page Component items, the content author can drill down in the category structure. You can use keywords or content associations to define the categories that are shown in the top-level view. The Page Component palette can be customized for content authors.
