# How tagging and rating works in the portal

Use these topics for general administrative information about tagging and rating in the portal.

<!--
-   **[How public and private tags and ratings work in the portal](../admin-system/tag_rate_adm_publc_privt.md)**  
Users can choose between applying a tag or rating as a private or public tag or rating.
-   **[Tagging and rating with anonymous users](../admin-system/tag_rate_adm_anonusr.md)**  
Anonymous users of the portal can tag and rate portal content, if an administrator adds the anonymous user to the appropriate roles on the virtual resources as described in the topic about Security for tagging and rating.
-   **[Grouping tags and ratings via resource categorization](../admin-system/tag_rate_adm_grp_rescat.md)**  
Users apply tags and ratings to resources. Users can tag and rate all resources that can be uniquely identified.
-   **[Normalizing tags](../admin-system/tag_rate_adm_norm_local.md)**  
The portal provides several options for normalizing tags. Normalization is a process of transforming a text fragment, such as a tag, into another, more generic representation. This bundles different spellings or grammatical versions of the same lexical word that users might use as tags, for example color, Color, COLOR, colour, colors, colored.
-   **[Type-ahead feature for the deprecated tag widget](../admin-system/tag_rate_adm_typeahead.md)**  
The tag widget from earlier HCL Digital Experience (DX) versions provided a type-ahead feature. With the latest version of HCL DX, that tag widget is deprecated. The type-ahead feature makes it easier for users to find suitable tags. Type-ahead supports users when they work with tags. For example, when users apply tags using the tag widget, or when they search for tags, for example by using the open search functionality, type-ahead provides users suggestions for tags that other users have applied already before. Type-ahead can also help reduce the number of variants of tags.
-   **[Filtering content for tagging](../admin-system/tag_rate_adm_filtr_cont.md)**  
You can use filtering mechanisms to control which terms users can use and which terms they cannot use as tags. The portal provides both a blacklist and a whitelist filter. -->
