# How public and private tags and ratings work in the portal

Users can choose between applying a tag or rating as a private or public tag or rating.

The differences between private and public tags and ratings are described in the following. All statements made for tags in the following are also applicable to ratings.

-   **Private tags**

    -   A private tag can be seen only by the user who applied it
    -   A user can apply the same private tag only once to one specific resource.
    -   A user can apply the same private tag to multiple resources. This means that an individual user can use the same tag more than once, but only once per resource.
    -   Users can only delete private tags that they have applied themselves. Users with a Manager role have more rights. For more information see the topic about *Security for tagging and rating*.
-   **Public tags**

    -   All public tags and ratings are visible to all users who belong to the community and who have access to the resource itself, independent of who created the tag or rating.
    -   A user can apply the same public tag only once to one specific resource.
    -   A user can apply the same public tag to multiple resources. This means that an individual user can use the same tag more than once, but only once per resource.
    -   The same public tag can be applied to the same specific resource by multiple users. In other words, all users can apply the same tag or rating to a resource once; as a result, the resource can have the same tag applied to it multiple times.
    -   Users can only delete public tags that they have applied themselves. Users with a Manager role have more rights. For more information see the topic about *Security for tagging and rating*.
    -   Public tags are also community tags.
