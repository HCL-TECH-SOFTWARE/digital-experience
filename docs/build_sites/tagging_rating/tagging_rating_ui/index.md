# The tagging and rating user interface

Learn about the user interface that HCL Digital Experience provides for users to work with tags and rating.

Portal tagging and rating offers the following user interface elements that users can use to work with tags and ratings:

-   The tag and rating widgets:
    -   The tag widget. This is an inline widget that you can add to your portal content and that users use to tag that portal content.
    -   The rating widget. This is an inline widget that you can add to your portal content and that users use to rate that portal content.
-   The tag cloud.
-   The Tag Center.
-   A feature for browsing tags.

!!! note
    With HCL Portal Version 8.5, both the dialog and inline tag and rating widgets of previous portal versions are deprecated. They are replaced by a single pair of new enhanced inline widgets. They provide the functionality of both types of the old widgets. Users view them as part of the portal resource.

You can configure the widgets by using a set of parameters. You can set these parameters globally for all tag or rating widgets in your portal in the WP CP configuration service. You can also set them for individual instances of the tag and rating widgets by using JavaScript parameters. All these parameters are listed and described in the topic about the WP CP configuration service and the parameter reference topics for tagging and rating.

The portal provides one widget each for tags and for ratings.
-   **[The portal Tag Center](../admin-system/tag_rate_tag_center.md)**  
The Tag Center is a separate portal page. It combines the tag cloud and the tags result list.
-   **[The portal tag cloud](../admin-system/tag_rate_tag_cloud.md)**  
The portal provides a tag cloud for aggregating tags for multiple resources. Users can select tags from the tag cloud.

Besides tagging content and viewing tags users can browse tags. This can be useful for finding related or similar content. -->
