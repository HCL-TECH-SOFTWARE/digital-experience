# Administering tag federation

When tags from remote systems, such as HCL Connections are integrated into your HCL Digital Experience site, you need to schedule tasks to retrieve tags and related data from the remote system, and later to clean them up from the portal. You can also redirect the rendering of federated resources to HCL Connections and add icons to federated resources.

When tags from remote systems, such as HCL Connections are integrated into HCL Portal, you need to schedule a task to retrieve the tags and related data from the remote system.
-   **[Cleaning up federated tags and resources](../admin-system/tag_fed_admin_cleanup.md)**  
When federated tags are no longer integrated in HCL Portal, you invoke the task com.ibm.wps.cp.tagging.federation.taskhandler.FederationDeletionTaskHandler to remove unnecessary data.
-   **[Redirecting to an HCL Connections site](../admin-system/tag_fed_admin_redirect.md)**  
When a user clicks an HCL Connections resource in the result list portlet, this resource is rendered within an HCL Connections portlet, if that portlet exists and can handle this resource.

When federated resources are displayed in the Tag Results portlet, you can have them preceded by a icon. --->
