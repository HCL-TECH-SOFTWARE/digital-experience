# Search V2

Search V2 replaces the existing Search feature in HCL Digital Experience (DX). This feature introduces a new search interface along with a new backend service that utilizes OpenSearch to provide a seamless search experience.

You can use Search V2 both in DX Core and [DX Compose](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/dx-compose/latest/){target="_blank"}. A full container deployment is required to use Search V2.

## Overview

Search V2 is made for, but is not limited to, the following sample use cases:

- Using the new Search page in DX once it is enabled.
- Adding functional web components provided through Javascript and CSS modules to your new or existing theme pages. This allows you to utilize the default styles or create your own stylesheet as necessary.
- Adding the new Search V2 Portlet Java application to a new page you created. This allows you to retain the same UI and functionality from your own page in another location.
