# Practitioner Studio

Practitioner Studio is a newly designed user experience for HCL Digital Experience. Please see the following pages to understand how the new navigation is organized.

!!! note
    With HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF192 and later, the following issues are experienced with use of the Safari web browser \(Version 13.0.5 \(15608.5.11\). These issues, which were found in **Web Content** from the Practitioner Studio side navigator, will be resolved in a later software update:

- List navigation is not accessible using keyboard
- Incorrect focus behavior in **Open Search** and **Close** sidebar buttons
- Remnant of highlight outline of **Search** icon remains after back-tabbing to **Back** link

## Overview

Practitioner Studio is a newly designed user experience for HCL Digital Experience.

There are several advantages to this new look. The consolidated navigation has a consistent look and feel for most administration tasks so that commonly used tasks are found together. User assistance is easily found and is provided for pages that are in the navigation.

In time, this interface also serves as the launching point for newly developed features.

Enabling Practitioner Studio deactivates the legacy Administration and Applications pages. However, all of these functions are still available.

### Enhanced Practitioner Studio and Toolbar

The Practitioner Studio and Toolbar in HCL Digital Experience have been significantly enhanced to provide a more intuitive and efficient user experience. The updated interface introduces a modern side navigation UI, making it easier for users to access key features and administration tasks. The improved navigation structure groups related functions together, streamlining workflows and reducing the time needed to locate commonly used tools.

These enhancements focus on usability and design, ensuring that both new and experienced users can quickly adapt to the updated layout. The side navigation offers clear pathways to essential areas such as web content, site templates, themes, personalization, and administration. With these updates, users benefit from a consistent look and feel across the platform, improved accessibility, and a more productive environment for managing digital experiences.
