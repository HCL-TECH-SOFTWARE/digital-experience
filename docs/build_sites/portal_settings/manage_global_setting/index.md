# Managing global settings


Define the settings for your portal server. These settings include the default portal language, the first page displayed when a user logs in, the option to set a URL for the Find feature, and what will be displayed when a user is not authorized to view a portlet.

When you have completed your option selection, click **Save**. To restore to the previous selection of options, click **Reset**.

A message informs you for which portal server you are setting portal settings.

**Note:** The **Global Settings** portlet does not work in portal cluster configurations.

-   **[Specifying the default portal language](h_gs_lang.md)**  
Use the **Default portal language** drop-down list to select the default language in which you would like the portal to appear.
-   **[Specifying how to handle portlets that the user is not authorized to view](h_gs_noview.md)**  
If a portlet is hidden from a user, you can choose between displaying a message or nothing at all.
-   **[Specifying what users see initially when they log in to the portal](h_gs_whatsee.md)**  
You can choose for users to return to the default portal page or to return to the page of their last visit after logging in, or you can allow users to choose a view after logging in.
-   **[Specifying the search engine that opens when users select Find](h_gs_search_engine.md)**  
You can add a URL for the search engine that your users can use in the portal.
