# Managing markup languages

You can use Manage Markups to define the types of markup languages to be supported by the portal.

Creating a new markup entry means that the portal gets informed about the capability to support a certain markup. It does not establish the new markup support itself. Before a new markup entry is created, the portal, as well as all portlets that are planned to be accessible with this markup, must provide for the appropriate aggregation resources. See Designing your portal in the Information Center for more information.
