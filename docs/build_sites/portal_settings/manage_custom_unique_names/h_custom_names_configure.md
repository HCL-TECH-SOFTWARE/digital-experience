You can specify the number of resources that you want to be listed on the page, configure how the resources will appear to all users or to particular instances of the portlet, or make individual changes to the portlet, depending on the available options and the task that you want to perform.

Depending on your access rights, you can configure or edit some of the standard features of the Manage Custom Unique Names portlet. To configure or edit the portlet, proceed as follows:

1.  Hover your mouse over the portlet title bar and view the downward arrow.

2.  Click the downward arrow to open the portlet context menu with portlet mode selection options.

    -   If you want to make changes to a particular instance of the portlet for all users, click **Edit Shared Settings**.
    -   If you want to make individual changes to the portlet, click **Personalize**.
    The panel for configuring, editing, or personalizing the portlet settings appears.

4.  Enter the required numbers and make the required selections:

    -   **Never show more than this number of items**

        This is an input field. Use this field to specify the maximum number of resources you want to be listed on the page.
