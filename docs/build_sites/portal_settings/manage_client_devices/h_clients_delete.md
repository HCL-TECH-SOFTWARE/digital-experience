You can delete unused search clients.

Perform the following steps to delete a client:

1.  Select the client from the list.

2.  Click **Delete selected client**.

    **Note:** After deleting a markup, the client still references the name of deleted markup definition. However, if you edit the client, Manage Clients displays HTML as the markup name. If the deleted markup will not be recreated, you should select a new markup and click **OK**. Otherwise, click **Cancel** to ensure the client is still mapped to the deleted markup name.
