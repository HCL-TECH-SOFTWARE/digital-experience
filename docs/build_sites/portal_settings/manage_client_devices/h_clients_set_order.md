---




The order in which the client is listed in the registry is important to ensure that the most exact markup is sent to the client.

Perform the following steps to set the order of the client in the registry:

1.  Select the client from the list in **Manage Clients**.

2.  Click **Order client before** to move the client up in the registry.

3.  Click **Order client after** to move the client down in the registry.


**Note:** These changes take effect immediately; you cannot reset, cancel, or save.
