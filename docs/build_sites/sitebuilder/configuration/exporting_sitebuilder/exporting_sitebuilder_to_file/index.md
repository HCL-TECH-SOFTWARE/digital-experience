# Exporting a Site Builder template to a file

HCL Digital Experience users can export a Site Builder site or section template to a file and import it to the target server later.

Exporting a site template or section template to a file downloads the file to the default location for your downloads.

**Note:** Do not import a Site Builder template that uses embedded page templates that are stored in the Portal Site library. Conflicts between duplicate page templates cause the imported Site Builder template to break on the destination server.

1.  Open Site Builder.

2.  Browse to the published Site Builder template you want to export and click **Export**.

3.  Click **Export and download the site template**.

4.  Make a note of the file name, so you can find it later.

5.  Click **Download**.

6.  Move the Site Builder template file to a location where you or someone else can import it.
