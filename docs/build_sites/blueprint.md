# Blueprint design system

Blueprint is a design system aimed at accelerating the implementation of new sites in the HCL DX platform. It implements an advanced system of rendering React components as page components, which are configured and hydrated with data from WCM library components and content items. It features a wide range of page components that can serve as patterns for quickly building your own set library of components. It comes with a theme that is easy to customize while maintaining consistency using design tokens. It also comes with site and page templates used to build the [Nex Haven sample site](./nex_haven.md), demonstrating the design system in action.

The Blueprint design system bundle is automatically included in a fresh deployment or update starting from CF229. Visit the [HCL DX Blueprint Storybook](https://pages.github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dx-blueprint-storybook/){target="_blank"} to learn more.
