# Blueprint Design System

Blueprint is a design system aimed at accelerating the implementation of new sites in the HCL DX Platform. It implements an advanced system of rendering React components on a portal page as page components which are then configured and hydrated with data from WCM library components and content items. It features a wide range of page components that can be used as patterns to quickly build one's own set library of components. It comes with a theme that is designed to be easy to customize while maintaining consistency through the use of design tokens. It also comes with a site and page templates used to build the [Nex Haven sample site](./nex_haven.md) which demonstrates the design system in action.

The Blueprint design sytem bundle is automatically part of a fresh deployment or update starting CF229. Visit the [HCL DX Blueprint Storybook](https://pages.github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dx-blueprint-storybook/) to learn more.
