# Managing the users of virtual portals

You manage the users of virtual portals by adding and configuring the user repository and later administering the users for virtual portals. The master administrator of the portal installation assigns sub-administrative users for the virtual portals. These virtual portal sub-administrators can manage the access rights of the user population of the virtual portal for which they are responsible.
