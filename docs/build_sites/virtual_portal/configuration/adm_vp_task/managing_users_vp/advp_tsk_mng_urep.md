# Adding and configuring the user repository for a virtual portal

For the user repository for your virtual portals, you have a choice of using either federated security or an LDAP.

When you enable security on a portal installation, by default you have Federated Security as WebSphere Security provider. For details, review the section about Configuring the portal.

As an alternative choice, the portal also supports the stand-alone WebSphere® Application Server Lightweight Directory Access Protocol \(LDAP\) user registry. You enable the user registry by using the configuration task wp-modify-ldap-security. In this case, you can use only the default realm.
