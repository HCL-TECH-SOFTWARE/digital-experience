8.  [Indexing web content](../search/indexing_webcontent/index.md)  
To search for web content, your content must first be indexed by the HCL Portal search engine. When the content is indexed, you can run searches by using the search center or by using a search component. If you search for documents in the WebSphere Portal search center, be aware that you see search results for published documents only. Unpublished pending changes in a project are not included in the results.
11.  [Language and region support in Portal Search](../search/language_region_support/index.md)  
Depending on your portal environment and your users, you might want to make multilingual content available and searchable in your portal.
12. [Crawling web content with search seedlists](../search/crawling_webcontent_seedbase/index.md)  
Portal Search supports the use of seedlists to make crawling websites and their metadata more efficient and to provide content owners fine-grained control over how content and metadata are crawled. You can configure the portal to use seedlist support when crawling content generated with HCL Web Content Manager.
13. [Searching your local portal](../search/searching_local_portal/index.md)  
View information on setting up your local portal for your users to search.
15. [Enabling anonymous users to search public pages of your portal](../search/enabling_anonymous_user/index.md)  
You can enable anonymous users \(sometimes also called unauthenticated users\) to search public pages of your portal by using the portal Search Center portlet. Search by anonymous users works only on public pages of your portal, as the users are not logged in to your portal.
17. [Redirecting search requests from a custom search form to the Search Center](redirect_search_custom_form.md)  
If you plan to develop a custom search form, you might want to redirect search requests issued by the search form to the Search Center.
18. [Remote search service](../search/remotesearch/index.md)  
You can configure the search portlets for local operation, or you can configure them for remote search service. Depending on your configuration, remote search service might have performance benefits by offloading and balancing system load.
