To support Search in a portal farm, you must install and configure a remote search service. Install and configure it on an IBM WebSphere Application Server instance that is not part of the farm.
-   **[Configuring JCR search in a portal farm](farm_install_search.md)**  
JCR-based content includes content that is created with Web Content Manager or Personalization.
