You can edit the following search options to manage how the search service works with Web Content Manager search forms

1.  Open WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console to configure the **WCM SearchService** properties. Go to **Resources** \> **Resource Environment** \> **Resource Environment Providers**.

2.  Select **WCM SearchService, Custom** properties.

3.  Specify values for the search parameters.

    -   **SearchService.DateFormatString**

        This parameter is used to set the date format when dates are entered in search forms. Enter a supported Java date format string. If this property is not set, then the default format is MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss z.

    -   **SearchService.RecrawlInterval**

        This parameter is the recrawl interval in hours.

    -   **SearchService.BrokenLinksExpirationAge**

        This parameter is the default broken links expiration age in days.

    -   **SearchService.MetaFields**

        This parameter is used to specify extra elements to crawl when searching for metadata.

        The format for this parameter value is: `elementName,key1`

        To specify more than one metadata field maps, use the following format:

        ```
        elementName1,key1;elementName2,key2;elementName3,key3
        ```

        For example, to crawl for metadata in a text element named metaText:

        -   ```
SearchService.MetaFields=metaText,meta
```

        -   `elementName` is the name of element you would like to search for metadata. Any valid element with that name in a searchable site area or content item is crawled.
        -   `key` is the "key" that is specified in an element tag that is used as part of a search element design. In the previous example, the key of "meta" is used. To render the content of the metaText element in a search element design, you would use the following tag: `<Element context="autoFill" type="content" key="meta"/>`

        !!! note
            -   Only text elements and short text elements can be searched.
            -   Only site areas that are configured to be searchable are crawled.
            
    -   **SearchService.SearchSeed.ExcludeFileAttachments**

        Set this parameter to `true` to prevent file resource component attachments from being included in the search results.

        If set to false, the files that are stored in file resource elements in content items can also be searched. Files that are stored in file resource elements in a site area can also be searched so long as a default content item is selected.

    -   **SearchService.SearchSeed.excludeExtensions**

        Set this parameter to a list of file name extensions that you want to exclude from search results. Separate each item in the list with a comma. Any file resource component attachments and file resource element attachments that have these extensions are excluded from search results. For example, `SearchService.SearchSeed.excludeExtensions=avi,mpeg,zip`.

    -   **Searchservice.searchseed.excludeContentResourceTypeElement**

        Set this parameter to true to exclude the default file resource element of a content item which is set to resource type from the seedlist, since the default file resource element is already being pointed to by the content item. The default setting is false.

4.  Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

5.  Restart the portal for the new settings to take effect.

6.  Delete and create a new search collection for changes to take effect.
