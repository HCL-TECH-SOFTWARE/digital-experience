# Configuring search in a cluster

HCL Digital Experience provides two distinct search capabilities. You can use both types of search capabilities in a clustered environment.


-   **[Configuring Portal Search in a cluster](clus_psearch.md)**  
To support Portal Search in a cluster, you must install and configure a remote search service on an IBM WebSphere Application Server node that is not part of the cluster.
-   **[Configuring JCR search in a cluster](config_jcr_search_clus.md)**  
To enable search in a cluster for content that is stored in the JCR database, you must configure each server in the cluster to access a directory. JCR-based content includes content that is created with Web Content Manager or Personalization.
