# Language and region support in Portal Search

Depending on your portal environment and your users, you might want to make multilingual content available and searchable in your portal.


-   **[Configuring search for multilingual sites](config_search_multi.md)**  

-   **[Language support and multilingual sites](srr_lang_spprt.md)**  
Internet search engines usually take care of language support in terms of language determination and language specific processing.
-   **[Region support and multi-regional sites](../language_region_support/region_multiregion_support/index.md)**  
Global companies might choose to publish content, and offer products or services specifically for certain regions. While today a language can be detected, there is no technical solution available to detect a region.
