# Customizing the Search Center

Customize the Search Center by adding, removing and configuring additional portlets, such as External Search Results or Recommended Links. The external search results portlet displays search results from third-party external search engines such as Yahoo and Google. Using the recommended links portlet, display search results from a collection of predefined links with predefined keywords. You can also configure the All Sources scope or replace it with a customized scope.
