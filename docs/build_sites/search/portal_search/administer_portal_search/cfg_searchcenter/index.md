# Configuring the Search Center portlet

Get an overview of how you configure the Search Center.

The Search Center is installed and ready to use in a default portal installation. It is available to authenticated users through the search box in the portal theme header action bar. Users can use the Search Center for basic searches.

If required, you can configure the Search Center for search by metadata that is contained within the meta elements and by search scopes. See the following topics for details.

If your users use external search services to perform searches in different languages, refer to [Using the Search Center with external search services with different languages](../../hint_tips/index.md).


-   **[Configuring search for multilingual sites](config_search_multi.md)**  
By default, the Search Center uses the preferred language of the user to analyze search terms and to refine the search results. Search results in different languages are not displayed. You can enable users to search for terms in a language other than their preferred language.
-   **[Configuring search scopes for the Search Center portlet](srtcfg_sc_scopes.md)**  
The Search Center provides scopes for users to select different sources for the search. A search scope is a means of filtering the search request to a predefined set of content or content source.
-   **[Configuring search by metadata for the Search Center portlet](srtcfg_sc_metadata.md)**  
You can configure the Search Center so that users can refine their search by metadata.
