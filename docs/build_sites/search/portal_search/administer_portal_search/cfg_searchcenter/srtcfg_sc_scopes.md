# Configuring search scopes for the Search Center portlet

The Search Center provides scopes for users to select different sources for the search. A search scope is a means of filtering the search request to a predefined set of content or content source.

For search collections provided by Portal Search you can configure the search scopes in the two following ways:

-   Each individual search collection is available through its own scope and selection option in the scope pull-down menu.
-   The search scope **All Sources** makes all search collections available for search. In other words, if a user selects the option **All Sources** selection option from the pull-down menu, the user's search will search all search collections that are available in the portal.

You can configure additional scopes. For more information about search scopes and how to configure them refer to Managing search scopes and custom links.
