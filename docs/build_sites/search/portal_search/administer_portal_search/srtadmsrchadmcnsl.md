# Using the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console to administer Portal Search

You can administer Portal Search by using the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console and using resource providers in XML format.

You can administer search services, search collections, and search scopes. You can create, configure, or delete these.

**Exception:** You can administer a user-defined categorizer, but you cannot administer the rules for a user-defined categorizer by using the WebSphere® Integrated Solutions Console.
