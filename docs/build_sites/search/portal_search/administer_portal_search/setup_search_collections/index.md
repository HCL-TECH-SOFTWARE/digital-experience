A JCR search collection is a special purpose search collection that is used by HCL Portal applications. It is not designed to be used alongside user-defined search collections. A JCR search collection requires a special setup. This setup includes the creation of a new content source for the search collection. Under normal circumstances, you do not need to re-create the JCR search collection. However, in rare cases you might need to re-create it, for example if you deleted the default JCR search collection.
