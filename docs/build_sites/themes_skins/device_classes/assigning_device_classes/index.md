# Assigning device classes

The process of assigning a device class to one of the supported clients in HCL Portal. Usually, when a certain device class needs to be supported, the first step is to create client definitions for each of the devices that belong to this class. Then, you create a device class and assign the device class to the clients. The assignment of device classes on clients is done in the Supported Clients administration section, using a specific capability on the client.
