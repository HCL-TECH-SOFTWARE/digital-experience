# Static resources

Static resources include the markup that is defined by .html, .css, and .js files that are used by the theme. Some .json files are used to define menu options, module definitions, and module profiles.

For more information about modularization and modules that are provided by the HCL Digital Experience Portal 8.5 Theme, see [Modules that are provided with the modularized theme](../the_module_framework/oob_modules/index.md). Each WebDAV folder has a readme file with additional information about each section.

On WebDAV: http://host:port/wps/mycontenthandler/dav/fs-type1.

## Style templates

fs-type1:\\themes\\Portal8.5\\css

Style templates contain the css definitions for the styles that are provided by the theme. The style options are shown in the **Style** tab on the site toolbar when in **Edit Mode**.

Each of the listed directories has a css definitions file for that style and an icon that contains the image that represents the style. For the black style, there is a black.css and an icon.gif file under the black directory.

The css directory contains the following directories and files:

-   Directories: black, blue, gold, green, orange, purple, red, white, images, and default.
-   Files:

    -   master.css: Includes the sideNav.css, and default.css files.
        -   Removed in Combined Cumulative Fix 06:
            -   contextmenu.css
            -   contextmenuCommon.css
    -   masterRTL.css: Includes the sideNavRTL.css, defaultRTL.css, and default.css files.
        -   Removed in Combined Cumulative Fix 06:

            -   contextmenuCommon.css
    These files contain the compressed \(minified\) versions of the css definitions.

    !!! note
        Compressing the files makes the files harder to read, so uncompressed versions are provided. It is best to use uncompressed versions when you are editing and debugging your theme CSS.


The default directory includes the base styles for the theme.Â The default\_view.css file contains styles for view mode. The default\_edit.css file contains styles for edit mode. The default\_search.css file contains styles for search. These styles are applied to the default theme and optimize it for mobile devices. These styles apply to menus, navigation, layout, and footer.

The images directory contains the following common images:

-   blank.gif: A blank gif file that is used for spacing.
-   loading.gif: The image that is shown when the page or other resource is loading.
-   loadingDark.gif: A darker version of the loading.gif image.
-   master.png: A sprite file with common images that are used in the theme. Some of the images in the sprite include the HCL and HCL Portal logos, search icon, the pencil icon for the edit/view mode toggle, and various sized arrow images.
