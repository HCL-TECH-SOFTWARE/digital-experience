# Theme Optimization Analyzer

Use the Theme Optimization Analyzer to view, but not edit, all parts of the theme optimization framework inside of HCL Digital Experience.

## Overview

The Theme Optimization Analyzer allows users to easily see which pages have specific profiles that are set or inherited. You can also see which profiles are available and belong to which theme.

Additionally you can browse and explore all aspects of the available modules: You can see what modules are loaded for a specific profile or all modules of the whole system. You can drill down into the dependency hierarchy to understand interdependencies and get different views on it, such as a parent view. The module explorer also features a rich search set so that you can easily find modules that contribute certain resources or capabilities, or browse all exposed data.

If you encounter problems, you can also export your set of data as a compressed file and share it with others. They can then import your data set and examine your profiles and modules.

The Theme Optimization Analyzer can be found in **Portal Analysis** \> **Theme Analyzer** in the **Administration** section of HCL Digital Experience.
