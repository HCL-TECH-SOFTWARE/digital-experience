# Changing theme metadata

The first step of theme configuration is through theme metadata properties. Changes to the metadata are specific to a single theme, and the entries and values, therefore, can vary from theme to theme.

Go to [Manage Theme Properties](../../getting_started_with_themes/themeopt_themedev_etp.md) to learn more about changing theme metadata by using the Theme Manager.

The theme metadata is located in the folder for your theme in themelist.

1.  Connect your WebDAV client to http://localhost:port/wps/mycontenthandler/dav/themelist/

2.  From the folder for your theme, copy the metadata.properties file to local drive.

3.  Edit the local copy of the file and modify the property values as needed according to the following table.

4.  Copy the local copy of the metadata.properties file back into the folder for your theme in themelist.
