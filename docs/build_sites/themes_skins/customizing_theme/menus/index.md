# Menus

You can customize the appearance and performance of your menus.

-   **[Simple menu framework](../menus/simple_menu_framework/index.md)**  
You can provide menu feeds in JSON format instead of XML format. The operations can then parse the JSON feed without requiring the XML parsing support in the Dojo toolkit.
-   **[Adding a link to the resource permissions administration portlet in a menu](themeopt_cust_resrcpermiss.md)**  
You can add a link to the resource permissions portlet to see or modify role types or inherited access.
-   **[Updating the content menu to open on click instead of on hover](themeopt_update_con_menu_open.md)**  
The content menu opens when a user hovers over a portlet containing HCL Web Content Manager items. In Combined Cumulative Fix 05, you can set the content menu to open when a user clicks an icon in the portlet skin instead.
