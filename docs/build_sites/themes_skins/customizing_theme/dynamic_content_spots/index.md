# Dynamic content spots

The static template files use dynamic content spots to reference JSP files or other dynamic resources. The dynamic resources are stored in a WAR file.

-   **[Creating custom dynamic content spots](themeopt_themedev_create_dynamic_content_spots.md)**  
After you create a new theme, you can customize it by creating your own dynamic content spots.
-   **[Working with dynamic content spots](../dynamic_content_spots/index.md)**  
You can add dynamic content to your custom theme by using either client-side or server-side logic.
