# Editing static theme resources and connecting with WebDAV

After you create a new theme, you can edit the static resources that are associated with the theme.

Static theme resources include the theme.html file, layout templates, skins, JavaScript, CSS, and image files. The resources are stored by default within WebDAV, which is accessible with any WebDAV client. Learn more about [WebDAV](../../../manage_content/wcm_delivery/webdav/index.md) here.

1.  Create a directory where you want to save the static theme resources.

2.  Use a WebDAV client to switch into the new directory.

3.  Enter all the necessary information.

4.  Select your new theme from the list of themes that appears.

5.  Use a WebDAV client to download all of the static theme resources to your local hard drive and watch all files for changes.
