# Expression language beans for accessing programming models

Expression language \(EL\) beans are available for accessing WebSphere Programming models. These beans are accessed through the PortalBean represented in the global namespace by wp. The beans provide access to HCL Digital Experience models and associated classes.

## PortalBean

The PortalBean provides access to EL Beans that represent some of the HCL Digital Experience models. You can use these models to access resource information in your JSPs.

You can access the PortalBean \(wp\) with the following items. Append the following beans to `wp.` to create a bean in your JSP. For example, `wp.themeList.current` gets the current element and returns [Theme](themeopt_el_bean.md).

-   **[wp.ac](../expression_language_beans/access_control/index.md)**

    Provides read access to the current access control permissions for a resource.

    -   **[AccessControl](../expression_language_beans/access_control/themeopt_el_bean_acc_crtl_node.md)**
