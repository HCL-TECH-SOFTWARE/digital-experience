# Skins

You can apply ready-use skins to your portal pages, modify the existing skins, or add your own custom skin to change how your pages display.

-   **[Skin templates](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_skintemp.md)**  
The static skin template skin.html is located in the root directory of the skin folder of the WebDAV file store. The skin.html file provides the full markup for decoration around a portlet or iWidget. As with theme templates, you can use dynamic content spots to add dynamic elements to the skin template at run time.
-   **[Creating skins](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_skincreate.md)**  
You can create global or theme-based skins to customize a theme. A successful approach to creating custom skins is by copying one of the default skins files, then adding images, JavaScript files, and other custom resources.
-   **[Default skins](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_skindefault.md)**  
The default theme includes these skins that can be used as a basis for creating custom skins: Hidden, Standard, and NoSkin.
