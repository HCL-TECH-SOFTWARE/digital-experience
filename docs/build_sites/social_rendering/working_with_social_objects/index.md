# Working with lists of social objects

You can design lists of social objects in different ways that are related to their content, visual design, and other characteristics. You can also use the HCL Digital Experience Tag Cloud portlet in combination with your lists of social objects, so that your site visitors can navigate social data based on tags. These tasks are usually done by page editors.

-   **[Concept of the lists of social objects provided with the social rendering feature](../social/soc_rendr_undrstd.md)**  
The social rendering feature provides you with a set of predefined lists view definitions and a detail view definition for forum topic details.
-   **[Using the view definitions provided with social rendering on your portal pages](../social/soc_rendr_use_oob_socl_list.md)**  
The social rendering feature provides you with a set of predefined view definitions. You can add them to the pages of your HCL Portal and modify them according to your requirements. For example, you can define which types of social objects are listed, how they are filtered, sorted, and presented. These tasks are done by a page editor.
-   **[Using social lists with your own custom theme](../social/soc_rendr_use_oob_socl_list_wcusthm.md)**  
The social lists that social rendering provides work with portal pages that have the Portal 8.5 theme with a Basic Content theme profile. To use them with your own custom theme, you add the wp\_social\_rendering\_85 theme module to your theme.

-   **[Using the portal Tag Cloud with lists of social objects](../social/soc_rendr_tag_cloud_w_socl_list.md)**  
To get the most benefit from social rendering together with tagging, you can put the HCL Portal Tag Cloud portlet on pages that contain social lists. This way your site visitors can reduce the contents of social lists by selecting individual tags from the tag cloud. The list of social objects is then restricted to content items that are tagged with the tag or tags that the user selected.
