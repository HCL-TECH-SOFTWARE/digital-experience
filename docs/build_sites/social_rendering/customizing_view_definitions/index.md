# Customizing view definitions for portal site visitors

You can customize social rendering view definitions in a number of ways. For example, you can determine the social data that is shown and the visual appearance of the data. You customize social rendering by working with the social list definition authoring template. For custom view definitions, you can also create your own authoring templates.

Typically, a website designer does these customizing tasks.

!!! note
    If you want to customize the web content that the sample web content library named Social Lists 1.0 provides, create a copy of that library and customize that copy.

You can create your own custom list view definitions by creating new content items from this authoring template. To customize social rendering even further, you can also create your own authoring templates to extend the data set that makes up your list view definitions.
