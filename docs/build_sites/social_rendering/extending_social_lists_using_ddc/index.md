# Extending social lists by using the digital data connector

The social rendering feature in HCL Digital Experience 8.5 is implemented as an Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal plug-in.

This approach makes it possible to use the extensibility features of this framework to extend the social rendering feature with extra capabilities:

-   Realize custom queries against the HCL Connections server.
-   Retrieve data from HCL Connections services other than the search service.
-   Make it possible for portal site visitors to contribute social information through user interfaces that are generated by HCL Web Content Manager features.

To implement the HCL Connections data integration, the social rendering feature in HCL Digital Experience 8.5 uses a custom Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal plug-in.

HCL Connections provides a comprehensive remote API. You can use this API to access social data through Atom feeds.
-   **[Dynamic HCL Connections source URL construction](../social/soc_rendr_dyn_conn_srcurl_cnstrct.md)**  
To dynamically construct HCL Connections query URLs, you can use the \[Plugin:ConnectionsContext\] and \[Plugin:ResourceURL\].
-   **[Organizing your custom HCL Connections queries](../social/soc_rendr_org_cust_conn_qurs.md)**  
For the different query URLs that you want to use, you can create multiple dynamic or static HCL Connections query URL components. For convenient use of these query URL components, you can create a generic authoring template for all list definitions that you want to build from those queries.
