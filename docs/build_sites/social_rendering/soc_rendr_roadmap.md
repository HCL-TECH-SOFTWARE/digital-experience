# Roadmap: How to work with social rendering

Before you can use social rendering in your HCL Digital Experience, you need to set up HCL Connections integration. After you do that, your users can start working with the default view definitions that social rendering provides. You might want to configure and customize the social data that is rendered on your portal pages for your site visitors. In this case, you can configure and administer social rendering as required for your portal. You can also customize the view definitions, or create your own custom appearance components.

To go the fast path of using social lists, proceed as follows:

1.  Set up HCL Connections integration.
2.  If you want to use the Forum Topic Details view, you must also install the HCL Connections page resolver component.
3.  You can now work with the default social lists immediately. Read the tasks that are listed under *Working with lists of social objects*. These tasks are done by a page editor or by site visitors.
