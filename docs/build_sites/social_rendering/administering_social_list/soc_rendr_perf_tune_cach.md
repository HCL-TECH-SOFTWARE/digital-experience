# Performance tuning for lists of social objects

Social data that is rendered on your portal pages by using the social rendering feature is retrieved from a remote HCL Connections server. To reduce network traffic and improve performance, the data is cached on HCL Digital Experience.

Social rendering uses the caching infrastructure of the Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal. For more information, read *Digital Data Connector cache tuning*.
