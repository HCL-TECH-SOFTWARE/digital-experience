Many capabilities are included to retrieve content from external sources. You can use Web Content Integrator, REST services for HCL Web Content Manager, Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal, specialized portlets, WSRP, and other mechanisms to retrieve and render content from sources outside your digital experience.

## IBM® Web Content Integrator

The Web Content Integrator is a solution for integrating externally managed Web content with HCL Portal. Through the use of standard content syndication feed technologies based on RSS 2.0, the Web Content Integrator provides a loosely-coupled mechanism for transferring published content and metadata to the portal after they have been approved in the source system. Once the content and metadata have been transferred to the portal, it is possible to use the built-in content management features of HCL Portal to secure, personalize, and display the content to users.

## REST service for Web Content Manager

The REST service for Web Content Manager is a collection of web services that are compliant with the Atom Publishing Protocol. They provide access to web content, including versions and workflow states, through HTTP. The service is designed according to the REST \(REpresentational State Transfer\) architectural style.

REST services make it easy to build interactive content, which can be modified directly by your site users. Responsive, integrated editing tools can be created by embedding HTML and JavaScript in web content components, which bind to the REST service to display or update content asynchronously. \(Ajax\)

## Digital Data Connector

Use the Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal to integrate data from external data sources on portal pages by using HCL Web Content Manager presentation components. With Digital Data Connector, content authors and designers can use Web Content Manager presentation components to generate the web page markup for external data.
