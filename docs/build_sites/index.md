# Build Sites

HCL Digital Experience provides an array of features that provides a seamless experience in developing your business sites. These features are agnostic to the deployment methods, hence can work smoothly irrespective of whether your application is deployed on-premises as containerized and non-containerized, on Kubernetes, or on hybrid environments.

Setting up a website includes, creating pages, adding navigation, setting up search, and adding content to the site. Themes are used to customize the portal's look-and-feel. Out-of-the-box templates and the site wizard can help you set up your portal site faster. You can add wikis and blogs to your site and let users tag and rate content on your site.
