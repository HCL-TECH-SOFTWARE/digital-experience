# Managing tagging and rating for web content 

When you use tagging and rating with web content, the web content viewer provides extra scope options for the filtering of tagging and rating results. Because changes in the web content system can affect the accuracy of the tagging and rating information that is used by the portal, it is important to keep the scope information up to date by synchronizing the scopes regularly.

-   **[Applying tagging and rating scopes to web content ](../wcm/wcm_tagrate_scope.md)**  
Scoping is typically used to filter the tag cloud or ratings overview according to hierarchical metadata attached to the resources that are being tagged. When you apply tagging and rating to web content, you can scope these display components according to authoring template, category, or content item parent.
-   **[Synchronizing scopes for web content ](../wcm/wcm_tagrate_syncscope.md)**  
When users are tagging or rating web content, the web content viewer provides the tagging or rating information to the portal, where it is stored. If information in the web content system changes, this change can cause the tagging and rating information that is stored in the portal to be out of sync. This issue can happen, for example, if content items are moved or category information changes. To ensure that the tagging and rating information is current, synchronize the scopes that are used for web content. You can set up automatic synchronization according to different conditions or run a manual synchronization as needed.
