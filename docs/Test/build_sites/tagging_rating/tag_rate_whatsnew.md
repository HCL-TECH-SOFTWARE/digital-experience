# What is new in tagging and rating

HCL Portal Version 9.5 uses the enhanced version of tag and rating widgets. Both the dialog and inline tag and rating widgets of HCL Portal Version 8.0 and earlier versions are deprecated. They are replaced by a single pair of new enhanced inline widgets. They provide the functionality of both types of the old widgets. Users view them as part of the portal resource.

The enhanced inline widgets have the following advantages:

-   The enhanced widgets combine the functionality of the dialog widgets and the inline widgets of earlier portal versions.
-   With the enhanced widgets, users can create, modify, and delete tags and ratings that they have assigned themselves. With the earlier inline widgets, user could only view tags and ratings. 
-   The widgets provided by HCL Portal Version 8.0 and earlier versions required Dojo support. The enhanced widgets are light-weight, as they work without Dojo.
-   The enhanced widgets provide easy and convenient access to various actions, for example switching between different scopes and viewing rating distribution.

For more detailed information about the enhanced tag and rating widgets, read *The tag and rating widgets*.

To use the enhanced widgets after a portal upgrade to version 8.5 or later, you need to enable the widgets by running a configuration task. For more information, read *Enabling the new tag and rating widgets after a portal upgrade*.

In a default HCL Portal installation, the enhanced tag and rating widgets are enabled for specific profiles. You can enable and disable the enhanced widgets for additional profiles. For more detailed information, read *Enabling and disabling the tag and rating widgets for additional profiles*.

The deprecated Dojo tagging and rating menu options of the earlier default widgets are still available in HCL Portal Version 9.5. They are enabled for specific profiles. You can enable and disable them for additional profiles. For more detailed information, read *Enabling and disabling the Dojo tagging and rating options for additional profiles*.
