# Integrity

Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized and or unexpected changes made to the information. 

-   **[Java 2 security](../integrity/sec_java2.md)**  
Java 2 (J2SE) security provides a policy-based, fine-grain access control mechanism that increases overall system integrity by checking for permissions before allowing access to certain protected system resources.
-   **[Configuring Session Security Integration](../integrity/ssi_cons.md)**  
Session security integration is enabled by default on later WAS versions and HCL Digital Experience Containers.
-   **[Content Security Policy](../integrity/content_sec_policy)**  
The Content-Security-Policy header is used by modern browsers to enhance security of HCL Digital Experience site documents or webpages by allowing HCL Digital Experience administrators or developers declare which dynamic resources are allowed to load.
