# Link element

A link element stores a link to a web content item, or to external content such as a web page.

Most web pages contain links, either to other web pages, or to files. In a web content site, most links are generated by using navigator and menu elements. A link element stores a link that is not part of a site's navigation. For example, you can store a link to your "home" content item in a link element. You then add a reference to the link element in every presentation template that is used by your site to enable users to return to the "home" content item. If you want to change your "home" content, you change the selected item in the link element.

## Creating a link element

To create a link element, you can either add a link element to an authoring template, site area or content item, or create a link component.
