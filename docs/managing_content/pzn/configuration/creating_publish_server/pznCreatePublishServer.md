import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';



1.  From the Personalization Navigator, click **New** \> **Publish Server**.

2.  Type a server name and select the folder where the content spot is located.

3.  Type a publish servlet URL.

4.  Type a workspace.

5.  Select how the publish server handled deleted resources:

    -   The **Smart delete** checks your local server and deletes any objects no longer in your Personalization workspace.
    -   The **Leave deleted resources on server** overwrites objects on the server with updates but does not delete objects that are no longer in your Personalization workspace.

-   **[Publishing personalization resources](pznPublishing.md)**  
You can publish all the items in the workspace or selected items.
