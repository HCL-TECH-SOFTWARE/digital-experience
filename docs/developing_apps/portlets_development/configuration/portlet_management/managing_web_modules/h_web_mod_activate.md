import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';



To activate an application, select **Activate** on the row of the Web module. You will receive a message specifying if the activation was successful. If it failed, you will also see a message explaining the cause of the failure. If the status column is blank, then the application is already active. The status of an inactive application is stopped.

**Note:** A portlet cannot be stopped from the portal server. It must be stopped from the WebSphere Application Server.
