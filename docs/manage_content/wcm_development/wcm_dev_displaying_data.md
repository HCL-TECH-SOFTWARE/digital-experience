# Displaying data from external sources

You display data from external sources, such as SQL databases, by using the same methods as you would when you create a website.

## Displaying data

You can display content from external sources by using standard Java tag libraries and a [JSP element](../wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/content_management_artifacts/elements/jsp_element/wcm_dev_elements_jsp.md). Java code that uses standard Java APIs or tag libraries can be used to display and format data from databases, LDAP repositories, or send email.

If you use a rendering portlet to display web content on a portal page, you can also use other HCL Digital Experience portlets on the same portal page to display data.

## Web page aggregation

Content from external websites and HCL Web Content Manager can be displayed together on a portal page by using standard HCL Portal portlets for displaying content from external websites. Refer to the web Page portlet and Web Clipping portlet sections of this HCL Product Documentation for information about creating and configuring these portlets.

This function is only available when you display content in HCL Portal. These portlets are not accessible from the Web Content Manager servlet, though standard Java API or tag libraries can be used with a JSP element to achieve the same result.
