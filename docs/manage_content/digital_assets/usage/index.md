## Digital Asset Search
### Overview

The DX Digital Asset Search helps you quickly find and retrieve digital assets across multiple repositories. You can search by keyword, metadata, or content to locate the right asset when needed. The unified search experience streamlines content management and makes assets easier to discover and reuse in your applications.

### Steps

1. Find your assets by using full-text search on the name, description, keywords, or all of them.
