# Manage collections

Learn more about creating, configuring, and deleting media asset collections using Digital Asset Management (DAM).

## What is a collection unique-name?

Collection unique-names are the unique identifier for each collection which can be used in friendly url instead of collection UUID to access DAM assets. Collection unique-names support all languages as per existing system. A collection unique-name does not support any URL reserved characters (e.g. "?!#$&%'*+/;:,=@()\[]").

## How are collection unique-names generated?

- While creating a collection, the user has a provision to enter a custom collection unique-name.

![](../../../../images/CreateCollection_friendlyUrl-1.png "Create collection popup"){ width=45% }
![](../../../../images/CreateCollection_friendlyUrl-2.png "Create collection popup"){ width=47% }
![](../../../../images/CreateCollection_friendlyUrl-3.png "Create collection unsupported unique name"){ width=45% }

- Collection unique-name is an optional field. If it is not provided by the user, the system will generate a collection unique-name based on the collection name replacing all the URL reserved characters (e.g. "?!#$&%'*+/;:,=@()\[]") with underscores.
- Collection unique-names will follow simple format of adding “_Number” for collections having same collection-names.
- For existing collections, the system will generate a collection unique-name based on the collection name by using the migration script.

## How can the user change the collection unique-names?

Once the collection unique-name is generated, user can view/edit the collection unique-name in the collection information panel.

![](../../../../images/CollectionEdit_friendlyUrl.png "Collection edit panel"){ width=47% }
![](../../../../images/CollectionEdit_friendlyUrl-1.png "Collection edit panel"){ width=45% }

## What happens if a collection unique-name already exists while creating or editing a collection?

While creating or editing a collection, DAM checks for any duplication of the unique-name and prompts with an error message. It also suggests an available unique-name if a duplicate is found in any other collection.

![](../../../../images/CreateCollectionError_friendlyUrl_1.png "Create collection duplicate unique name"){ width=45% }
![](../../../../images/CreateCollectionError_friendlyUrl_2.png "Create collection suggestion click"){ width=45% }

When the user clicks on the suggested name, the unique-name input field gets pre-filled with the suggested unique-name.

![](../../../../images/EditCollectionError_friendlyUrl_1.png "Edit collection duplicate unique name"){ width=45% }
![](../../../../images/EditCollectionError_friendlyUrl_2.png "Edit collection suggestion click"){ width=50% }

## Browsing and searching for media assets in a collection

Follow these steps to work with Collections in HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DAM.

1. From the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DAM user interface, click **Collections**. The HCL DAM user user interface allows you to see previews of media assets for a specified collection. For example, a curated set of media assets are grouped in a collection named **Furniture Gallery** as shown below.

    ![Digital Asset Management user interface](../../../../images/dam_upload_media_collections.png)

    Following options are displayed in Collections interface:

    - **Create Collection** - Create a new collection or a new nested collection (when used inside an existing collection)
    - **View information** - Opens the Information panel and shows Access Control

            - Order by file name by **Older to newer** date
            - Order by file name by **Newer to older** date

        - **Name**

            ![Name > Z to A](../../../../images/dam_grid_name_z_to_a.png)

            - Order by file name from **A-Z**
            - Order by file name **Z-A**

        - **Type**

            ![Type > Descending](../../../../images/dam_grid_type_descending.png)

            - **Ascending**
            -  *Descending**
            
        - **Size**

            ![Size > Larger to smaller](../../../../images/dam_grid_size_larger_to_smaller.png)

            - **Smaller to larger**
            - **Larger to smaller**

    ![Assign access rights > Select](../../../../images/dam_access_control_assign_member_access_rights_select.png)

8. Once done, click **Add users and groups** to save changes.

## Deleting a collection

1. From the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Digital Asset Management interface, hover over a collection and click **Delete**.
2. A pop-up message displays to confirm your action. Once a collection is deleted, you can no longer retrieve it, including the media assets, renditions, and versions you have used as your web content.
3. Click **Delete** to proceed with deleting the collection.

## Moving a collection

Refer to the following steps if you want to move a collection from one location to another.

!!! note 
    If a collection is moved to another collection, permissions and access restrictions of the collection and its contents align with the permissions of the destination location. If the collection is moved to the root level, the permissions align with the source permissions. 

1. From the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Digital Asset Management interface, hover over a collection and click **Move collection**.

    ![Move collection option](../../../../images/Move_collection_option.png)

    A dialog box appears that shows the list of collections. You can search for a specific collection, or you can also navigate inside a collection if a subcollection is present.

    ![Move collection dialog box](../../../../images/move_collection.png)

    !!!note
        If the user does not have edit access for the collection, the row for that collection is disabled in the dialog.

2. To move the collection, there are two options depending on the target location:

    - Select the target collection where you want to move the collection and click **Move here**.

        If a collection with the same name exists in the target collection, a dialog box to rename the collection appears.

    - If you want to move the collection to root level, do not select any collection in the dialog box. Just click the **Move here** button to move the collection to the root level.

3. Click **View Location** to navigate inside the collection.

### Configuration for enabling the Move Collection feature

The Move Collection feature can be enabled or disabled through the helm. By default, this feature is enabled.

```yaml
configuration:
  digitalAssetManagement:
    enableCollectionMove: true
```
