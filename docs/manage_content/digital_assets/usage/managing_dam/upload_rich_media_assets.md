# Uploading rich media assets

Follow these steps to upload rich media assets using HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Digital Asset Management \(DAM\).

1. From the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DAM user interface, click **Upload**. This allows you to view or search, select, and upload rich media assets, such as images and videos from your source repository, to be stored in HCL DAM.

    !!! notes

        - You can drag and drop rich media assets from your source or local repository to the HCL DAM user interface to upload selected rich media assets.
        - Once the Kaltura plugin is configured and enabled, automatic synchronization of videos happen in the background whenever a video is successfully uploaded.

            - Videos uploaded to HCL DAM are automatically synchronized.
            - Videos with the **SYNCED** status generates the thumbnail from Kaltura and displays the preview in HCL Digital Asset Management. Videos with other statuses will not have the preview thumbnail available.

            See the [Configure DAM - Kaltura integration](../../configuration/dam_extensibility/kaltura_configuration.md) topic for details.

2. (Optional) After selecting the rich media assets for upload, a warning prompt requiring confirmation is displayed if number of assets exceeds the **maxBulkUploadWithoutWarning** parameter configured in Helm.

3. Then you are prompted to either add the selected assets to an existing collection or create a collection.
4. Click **Create Collection** to add selected rich media assets to a new collection. Enter the **Collection Name** and **Collection Description** as applicable.

## Uploading using drag-and-drop

You can upload files and folders using the drag-and-drop feature. With this feature, you can add multiple folders and their contents to DAM. When you drag and drop folders to DAM, the system handles the upload of folders, their sub-folders, and their respective assets. The hierarchy of nested folders during the upload process is preserved.

To upload files and folders using drag-and-drop, refer to the following steps:

1. Select the folders or files to be uploaded from the system file explorer.

2. Drag and drop the files and folders into the DAM root page or any other sub-collection page.

3. (Optional) Upon dropping files and folders, a warning prompt requiring confirmation is displayed if their combined count exceeds the **maxBulkUploadWithoutWarning** parameter configured in Helm.

4. (Optional) If files are dropped into a root collection page, a dialog box appears where you can select the collection where you want to upload the assets.

All uploaded folders create a collection with the same name as the folder. The contents of the folders are uploaded into the same collection.

### Configuration to change maxBulkUploadWithoutWarning value

The maximum allowed bulk upload value is configurable through Helm.

```yaml
configuration:
  digitalAssetManagement:
    maxBulkUploadWithoutWarning: 100
```

!!!note

    - If the Kaltura plugin is configured and enabled, the media tile shows the following sync statuses for uploaded videos:

        - SYNC IN PROGRESS
        - SYNC FAILED
        - SYNCED
        
        See the [Configure DAM - Kaltura integration](../../configuration/dam_extensibility/kaltura_configuration.md) topic for details.

    - The interface displays features that allows you to edit media asset metadata (for example, `Title` and `Description`) and user access control (for example, Access) of the new or existing collection the rich media asset is uploaded to. For more information, see [Manage collections](manage_collections.md).

    - To upload folders without using drag-and-drop, you must [manually create collections](#uploading-rich-media-assets) and upload assets using the **Upload** button.
