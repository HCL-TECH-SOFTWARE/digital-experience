# Set unique custom URL for a media asset

The media assets in the HCL Digital Asset Management (DAM) can be accessed through a URL. However, this URL is long and complex since it contains unique identifiers to locate the resource. Digital Asset Management allows users to customize complex URLs and change them to human-readable URLs, which are shorter, readable, and easier to use.

A `customUrl` provides the original rendition of an asset. The `customUrl` is not related to a friendly URL.

**Sample `customUrl`**:    

```

```

## Setting a unique custom URL for a media asset

Follow these steps to set a unique custom URL value for a media asset:

1.  From the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DAM user interface, click to select the collection where the media asset is located.
2.  Hover over a media asset and click **Edit** (pencil icon).
3.  Click **Information** and enter the expected text in the **Custom URL** field. A helper text shows a preview of the custom URL below the field.

    !!! note 
        Supported values for the **Custom URL** field:

        -   Custom URL values are unique for a media asset and are associated to the latest version of any rendition.
        -   They should not contain special characters except underscore \(“\_”\), hyphen \(“-”\), and forward slash \(“/”\).
        -   They should not contain any white spaces.
        -   They can be represented as a file path \(for example ../events/team-outing/images/image000\) for better categorization and classification of media assets.
        -   Every rendition of a media asset can have a Custom URL value associated to it.
        -   To access the media asset using custom URL:
            -   ```
                GET `/dx/api/dam/custom/<customurlText>`
                ```

        -   To add/update/delete custom URL value:
            -   ```
                PUT `/collections/<collectionId>/items/<itemId>/renditions/<renditionId>`
                ```

            -   ```
                PATCH `/collections/<collectionId>/items/<itemId>/renditions/<renditionId>`
                ```

4.  Click **Save**. A **Copy link** option appears on top of the **Custom URL** field. You can access the media asset using the custom URL after you click the **Copy link** option. A notification shows custom URL is copied successfully.
