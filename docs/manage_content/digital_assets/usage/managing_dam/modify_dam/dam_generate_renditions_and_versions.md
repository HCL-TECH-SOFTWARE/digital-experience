# Generate renditions and versioning

Learn more how to view, edit, and manage media asset renditions and versions with HCL Digital Asset Management \(DAM\).

## Prerequisite

HCL Digital Asset Management should be installed and configured to HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Release Update CF181 and higher. See the [Install the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container components](../../index.md) topic for instructions.

## Access media asset renditions and its versions

Renditions of the assets are system-generated for desktop, tablet, and smartphone displays. However, content creators can apply the asset edit options using HCL Digital Asset Management, select and apply the results to a specific rendition type to optimize that rendition display and create new versions of renditions.

Follow these steps to access renditions of a media asset using HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DAM.

1.  From the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Digital Asset Management interface, hover over a media asset to access **Edit** options. Select the Edit \(pencil\) icon.

    !!! note 
        Except for supported image files, some of the features will not be available for media assets.

    -   Edit **Desktop**, **Smartphone** or **Tablet** rendition and creating a new version;
