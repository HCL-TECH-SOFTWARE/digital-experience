!!! note 
    -   You can set the maximum file size for the DAM asset uploads. For more information on configuring the file size, refer to the [MediaTypeGroupController.updateById](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/experience-api-documentation/dam-api/#operation/MediaTypeGroupController.updateById) API documentation topic.
    -   SVG file type is disabled. If you wish to enable .svg file type (extension image/svg+xml) for asset upload, you can enable it via API using enabled parameter.

## Playing a video in DAM

Play uploaded videos in DAM using the DAM binary URL or the Kaltura Player \(if the Kaltura plugin is configured and enabled\):

-   Use the DAM binary URL when:
    -   The uploaded video synchronization status is SYNC FAILED.
    -   The Kaltura plugin is not configured and enabled.

        ![Using the DAM binary URL to play a video](../../../../images/dam_binary_url_for_failed.png)

-   Use the Kaltura Player when:
    -   The video synchronization status is SYNCED, play the video based on the configured Player ID.
    -   The Kaltura plugin is configured and enabled.

        ![Playing a video using the Kaltura Player](../../../../images/dam_kaltura_player_for_synced.png)

!!! note 
    Videos being synced in progress displays a warning message and cannot be played yet.

![Warning message for sync in progress](../../../../images/dam_warning_message_for_in_progress.png)

For more information on the video synchronization statuses for uploaded videos, see [Upload rich media assets](upload_rich_media_assets.md).

## Downloading a media asset source, version, or rendition

## Copying a media asset

Refer to the following steps if you want to copy a media asset from one collection to another.

1. Click the **more menu** option of the asset. 

    This displays more options such as **Properties**, **Preview**, **Copy Link**, **Download**, **Copy**, **Move**, **Rename**, and **Delete**.

2. Click **Copy**.

    A dialogue box appears that shows the list of collections. You can search for a specific collection or you can also navigate inside a collection if a subcollection is present. 

3. (Optional) Check the **Add new keywords to existing** box if you want newly generated keywords to be added to existing keywords. This is available only when Plugin is enabled.

4. Select a collection you want to copy the asset to and click **Copy**.

    If you copied an asset to the same collection, a dialogue box to rename the asset appears. 

5. Click **View Location** to navigate inside the collection.

## Moving a media asset

Refer to the following steps if you want to move a media asset from one collection to another.

!!! note 
    Moving an asset location can break its links if it is referenced in WCM or any external references. To update the link, manual relinking is necessary. 
    To view the asset references, go to **Properties > Insights**.

1. Click the **more menu** option of the asset. 

    This displays more options such as **Properties**, **Preview**, **Copy Link**, **Download**, **Copy**, **Move**, **Rename**, and **Delete**.

2. Click **Move**.

    A dialogue box appears that shows the list of collections. You can search for a specific collection or you can also navigate inside a collection if a subcollection is present. 

    ![Move a media asset](../../../../images/Move_Media_Asset.png)

3. Select the collection in which you want to move the item and click **Check for references and move**.

    The confirmation dialogue appears if the asset is referenced in WCM. If an asset with same name exists in the target collection, a dialogue box to rename the asset appears. 

5. Click **View Location** to navigate inside the collection.

## Renaming a media asset

Refer to the following steps to modify the name of a media asset.

!!! note 
    Renaming an asset name breaks existing references to the asset name in WCM or any external content. To update the asset name, manual relinking is necessary.

1. Click the **more menu** option of the asset. 

    This displays more options such as **Properties**, **Preview**, **Copy Link**, **Download**, **Copy**, **Move**, **Rename** and **Delete**.

2. Click **Rename**.

    A dialogue box appears for renaming the media asset. 

    ![Rename a media asset](../../../../images/Rename_Media_Asset.png)
    
3. In the **Rename** dialogue box, enter the new name of the media asset. Click **Save**. 

Another way to modify the name of a media asset is to edit the asset by clicking the **Pencil** icon. Go to **Properties**. You can edit the **Name** of the media asset in this panel, along with the **Title** and **Description**. Click **Save**.

### Configuration for enabling the asset rename and move feature

The asset move and renaming feature can be enabled or disabled through the helm. By default, this feature is enabled.

```yaml
configuration:
  digitalAssetManagement:
    enableAssetMoveRename: true
```

## Changing duplicate asset names using DAM

If an asset happens to have the same name with another asset in a collection, a notification is displayed in the **Information** panel.

![Notification to rename an asset](../../../../images/information_panel_rename_notification.png){ width=50% }

You can click **Rename** from the notification and provide a unique name.

![Rename asset dialog](../../../../images/dialog_rename_field.png){ width=50% }

## Copying friendly URLs for assets

You can can copy the friendly URL and API URL of an asset from the URLs section of the asset's inspector panel.
