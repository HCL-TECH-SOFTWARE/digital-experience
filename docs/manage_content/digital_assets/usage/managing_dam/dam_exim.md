# DAM Assets Export and Import (EXIM)

[Digital Asset Management](../index.md) (DAM) Assets Export and Import (EXIM) is a tool used for exporting the DAM assets from the source environment to the file system in a structured manner. It can also be used for importing DAM assets from the file system to the target environment.

## User access and control capabilities for HCL DAM EXIM users

DAM (EXIM) is exposed via [DXClient](../../../../extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/index.md).

Administrator users and authorized users with Administrator role privileges have access and control capabilities to DAM EXIM.

If you choose to export DAM assets to a target that does not share the same LDAP settings, then access rights is not transferred.

If you specify a path and run the command from the container, then assets will export or import to this location store/folder_name/.

## Limitations

DAM EXIM may be used to take a backup of DAM assets from any environment. The same backup can be used in other environment.

DAM EXIM cannot be used for continuous sync like DAM staging. Refer to [Sharing and staging DAM assets](../../configuration/staging_dam/index.md) for more information on how to configure a continuous sync of DAM assets.

DAM Staging is a continuous sync process between environments. If you are using DAM staging, then it is not necessary to use DAM EXIM.

## Export DAM assets

The export command is used to export the DAM assets in the file system to default location **store/outputFiles/dam-export-assets/** or if user specify a path, then DAM assets will export to this location **store/folder_name/**.

-   **Commands description**

    ```
    dxclient manage-dam-assets export-assets
    ```

-   **Help command**

    This command shows the help information for `manage-dam-assets` command usage:

    ```
    dxclient manage-dam-assets export-assets -h
    ```


-   **Command options**

    Use this attribute to specify the protocol with which to connect to the DX server:

    ```
    -dxProtocol <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify the hostname of the DX server:

    ```
    -hostname <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify the port on which to connect to the server\(e.g. for Kubernetes environment, `-dxPort` is 443\):

    ```
    -dxPort <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify the username that is required for authenticating with the server:

    ```
    -dxUsername <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify the password that is required for authenticating with the server:

    ```
    -dxPassword <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify the port number of the DAM server for any Kubernetes Environment. For example, default port is 443 \(`default: ""`\):

    ```
    -damAPIPort <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify the port number of the DX Core API server for any Kubernetes Environment. For example, default port is 443 \(`default: ""`\):

    ```
    -ringAPIPort <value>
    ```

    Use this attribute to specify a location **folder_path/folder_name/** that is different from the default location to export the DAM assets. The value of exportPath should be either an absolute or relative folder path. The default location "export" is **store/outputFiles/dam-export-assets/**:

    ```
    -exportPath <value>
    ```

    Use true or false to include or exclude binary as part of `export` \(default is true\):

    ```
    -exportBinary <value>
    ```

    !!! note 
        Optional parameters are `exportPath` and `exportBinary`.<br>
        If the exportPath value is not a relative or full path, the output will be placed in the container and will not persist after the command execution is complete. For example,`-exportPath outputFileDirectory`.

    !!! example

        ```
        dxclient manage-dam-assets export-assets -dxProtocol https -hostname <hostname> -dxPort <dxPort> -dxUsername <dxUsername> -dxPassword <dxPassword> -damAPIPort <damAPIPort> -ringAPIPort <ringAPIPort> -exportPath <exportPath> -exportBinary <exportBinary>
        ```

!!!important
    A new folder is created every time you run the `manage-dam-assets export-assets` command. If the specified `-exportPath` exists, the system throws the error `EBUSY: resource busy or locked,rmdir '/dxclient/store/<exportPath>`. Make sure to delete the existing `exportPath` before each run to export successfully.


## Validate exported DAM assets

The validate command is used to validate exported DAM assets file at the default location **store/outputFiles/dam-export-assets/** or if user specify a path, then validation of DAM assets will be done from this location **store/folder_name/**.

-   **Commands description**

    ```
    dxclient manage-dam-assets validate-assets
    ```


-   **Help command**

    This command shows the help information for `manage-dam-assets` command usage:

    ```
    dxclient manage-dam-assets validate-assets -h
    ```

-   **Commands Optional options**


    Use this attribute to specify a location **store/folder_name/** that is different from the default location to validate the DAM assets. The default location "export" is **store/outputFiles/dam-export-assets/**:

    ```
    -exportPath <value>
    ```

    Use true or false to include or exclude binary as part of validation \(default is true\):

    ```
    -importBinary <value>
    ```

    !!! note 
        Optional parameters are `exportPath` and `exportBinary`.

    !!! example

        ```
        dxclient manage-dam-assets validate-assets -exportPath <exportPath> -importBinary <importBinary>
        ```


## Import DAM assets

The import command is used to import the DAM assets to the target environment from the default location **store/outputFiles/dam-export-assets/** or if user specify a path, then DAM assets will import to this location **store/folder_name/**.

    ```
    dxclient manage-dam-assets import-assets -h
