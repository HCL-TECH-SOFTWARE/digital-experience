 Web Content Manager configuration settings can be scoped for individual virtual portals.
 - **[Disabling Workflow Actions](wcm_config_disable_actions.md)**  
 Disable workflow action on servers that do not require workflows to be processed, such as a subscriber. This strategy can improve performance and reduce the number of versions that are created for each item.
 - **[Enabling connect tags](wcm_config_connect.md)**  
 Enable connect tags to reference web content components and apply customized caching to the components.
 - **[Remove authoring configuration task](wcm_install_configtasks_removeauthoring.md)**

 Web Content Manager requires a user to run various system tasks such as initialization, and background tasks such as syndication. By default, this system user is the configured JCR domain administrator. In scenarios where the configured user realm does not contain the domain administrator then an alternative user must be provided.
 - **[Changing the login or redirect page used for servlet rendering](wcm_config_admin_redirect.md)**  
 When an unauthenticated user accesses secured content using servlet rendering, the user is redirected to the Web Content Manager login page by default.
