# Caching options

Both HCL Web Content Manager generated web pages and content from external data sources can be cached by the Web Content Manager application. If used correctly, Web Content Manager caching can dramatically increase the performance of a site.

Learn about the types of caching used by HCL Web Content Manager, basic web content caching, and advanced web content caching.
-   **[Caching versus pre-rendering](wcm_config_delivery_caching_comparison.md)**  
Content that is displayed in rendering portlets and through HCL Web Content Manager can be cached. An alternative to caching is the use of the pre-rendering feature. View the differences between each strategy.
-   **[Strategies for expiring content](wcm_config_delivery_caching_expiring.md)**  
Like caching strategies, a server's default expiration strategies can be set in the WCM WCMConfigService service by using the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console. Custom expiring parameters can also be set in connect tags and URL requests to override a server's default expiration strategies.
-   **[Web content cache configuration](wcm_config_delivery_caching_web.md)**  
You can tailor the caching behavior of your web content environment by changing configuration settings such as the default cache type and expire settings.
-   **[Data cache configuration](wcm_config_delivery_caching_data.md)**  
Data caching is used to cache data that is retrieved by the HCL Web Content Manager application from external sources that use connect tags or by requests that are made through URLs.
