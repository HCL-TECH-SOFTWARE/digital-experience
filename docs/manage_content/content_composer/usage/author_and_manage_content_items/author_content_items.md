# Author Content Items

This section provides the steps on how to author a web content item using HCL Content Composer.

## Prerequisite

Content Composer should be installed and configured to HCL Digital Experience 9.5 container release update CF181 or higher. See instructions to install to supported container environments in the [Install HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Components](/installation/install_config_cc_dam.md) topic.

Content Composer is accessible from the Practitioner Studio interface \(after image configuration to your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF181 and higher deployment\).
