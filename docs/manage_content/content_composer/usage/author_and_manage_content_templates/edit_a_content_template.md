# Edit Content Templates

This section provides the steps on how to edit a content template using HCL Content Composer.

## Prerequisite

Content Composer should be installed and configured to HCL Digital Experience 9.5 container release update CF181 or higher. See instructions to install to supported container environments in the [Install HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Components](../../installation/install_config_cc_dam.md) topic.

Content Composer is accessible from the Practitioner Studio interface (after image configuration to your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF181 and higher deployment).

## Set start and end of date range for Date and Time element

Users can set start and end of date range for the Date and Time element of a newly-created or saved content template.

1.  From your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Practitioner Studio interface, select **Web Content > Content Composer** from the navigator, and click **Create > Content Template** to create a new content template, or choose and click **Open Content Template** on a saved content template.

2.  On the content element interface, make sure that you are in **Edit mode**. Select the **Date and Time** element and complete the fields.

1.  Log in to your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 platform, and select **Web Content** from the Practitioner Studio navigator.
