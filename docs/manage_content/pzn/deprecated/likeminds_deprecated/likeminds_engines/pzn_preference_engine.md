# Preference Engine \| LikeMinds for HCL Digital Experience

The Preference Engine uses explicitly stated user preferences to make highly accurate recommendations for products and content that your site visitors like.

The Preference Engine enables customers get exposure to items they might otherwise miss. For example, users shopping for gifts can get recommendations based on the gift recipient's shopping preferences.

The shipped with the LikeMinds Recommendation Engine presents a typical implementation of the Preference Engine:

-   A user can rate a movie and LikeMinds returns a predicted rating for that movie.

    For example, a user can assign the movie Fantasia with a rating such as "I loved it". Internally the rating corresponds to a numerical value.

-   A user can ask for a recommendation about the best bet, which is provided by a LikeMinds rule. This corresponds to asking which movie a user would like the most among all available movies.
