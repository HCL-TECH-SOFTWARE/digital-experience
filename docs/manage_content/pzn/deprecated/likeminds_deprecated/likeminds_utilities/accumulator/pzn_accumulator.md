# Accumulator \| LikeMinds utilities

Use the accumulator utility if you are using the Item Affinity Engine. This utility accumulates the number of times every possible item-to-item combination occurs.

Similar to the `sifter` for the other LikeMinds engines, the `accumulator` runs in the background processing item event data. It writes this data to the table specified by the `<item_affinity_set>.item_affinity.output.table` setting. The `accumulator` is installed as part of the PZN\_Utilities.ear. It is run through the LikeMinds scheduling mechanism.
