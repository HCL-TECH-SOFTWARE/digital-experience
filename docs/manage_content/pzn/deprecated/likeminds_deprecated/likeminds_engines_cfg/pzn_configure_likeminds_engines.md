# Configuring the LikeMinds engines

You can configure your LikeMinds recommendation engines to control aspects such as predictability, number of mentors used, which rating, transaction, or mentor set to use, and so on, for the recommendations returned.

The Preference and Clickstream engines rely on the `sifter` utility to assign mentors to users. The Item Affinity Engine uses the `accumulator` utility to collect item affinity data.
