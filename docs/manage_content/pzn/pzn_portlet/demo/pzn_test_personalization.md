# Reviewing the PZNdemo

In [Installing the PZNDemo resources](./pzn_demoinstall.md), you installed the Personalization demo resources such as the backend database, pages, portlets, and users. In this exercise, you can review the personalized pages for each user.

By default, when the Personalization demo (PZNDemo) is installed, the following users are created:  

- andy  
- scott  
- tawana  
- marge

1. Log in as one of the pzndemousers (for example, "scott") to HCL DX. Use **pzndemo** as password for each user.  
2. Navigate to **Personalization > Demo**.
3. Click the different pages and portlets for each user. Notice the different information displayed for each user.  

    !!!note
        If no personalized data are displayed on the pages, click **Initialize Database** to start the database.  
        After starting the database, log out and log in to your Portal and check the pzndemo pages. You do not have to click **Initialize Database** again.
