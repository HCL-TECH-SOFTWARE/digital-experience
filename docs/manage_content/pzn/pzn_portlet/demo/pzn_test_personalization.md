# Testing the personalization demo

In the previous steps the personalization demo resources (backend database, pages, portlets and users) got installed by using automated ConfigEngine commands. In this exercise these personalized pages can be reviewed.

By default, when the personalization demo (PZNDemo) is installed, the following users are created:  

- andy  
- scott  
- tawana  
- marge  

## Review the PZNDemo portal pages

1. Log in as one of the pzndemousers to your Portal. Use **pzndemo** as password for each user.  
2. Navigate to **Personalization > Demo**.
3. Click the different pages and portlets for each user. Notice the different information displayed for each user.  

    !!!note
        If no personalized data are displayed on the pages, click **Initialize Database** to start the database.  
        After starting the database, log out and log in to your Portal and check the pzndemo pages. You do not have to click **Initialize Database** again.  

   The following images are sample pages of the Personalization demo for each user.
