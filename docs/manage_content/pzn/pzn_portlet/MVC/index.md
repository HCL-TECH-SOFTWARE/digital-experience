# Developing a personalized portlet using Microsoft Visual Studio Code

It is highly recommanded to review first the detailed steps mentioned in section [Developing a personalized portlet using IBM Rational Application Developer](../RAD/index.md) to get a better understanding on the different kind of development steps that are needed to use the Portal personalization API.  

Microsoft Visual Studio Code (MVC) currently has no wizard like the IBM Rational Application Developer that can be used to create hrf files. (hrf-files will be used to do the data mappings between the rules, java classes and the backend databases). It also does not contain a feature to automatically create the required java classes for the resource-mappings like IBM Rational Application Developer does. The following steps help to import the existing Pers_Offers personalization sample into Microsoft Visual Studio Code with all its source-codes. The project can be compiled and packaged with MVC. The intention is to provide an example that then can be used to do own modifications.

1. [Prerequisites for the Personalization portlet exercise](./pzn_demoprereq.md)  
2. [Install the Pers_Offers portlet](./install_pers_offers_portlet.md)
3. [Review the Pers_Offers project](./review_pers_offers_project.md)  
4. [Import the pzn-rules into Portal](./import_pzn_rules_portal.md)  
5. [Test the Pers Offers Portlet](./test_pers_offers_portlet.md)
6. [Uninstall Pers Offers Portlet and the PZNDemo](./uninstall_pers_offers_and_resources.md)
