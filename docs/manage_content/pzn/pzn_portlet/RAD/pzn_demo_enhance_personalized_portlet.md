# 11. Enhancing the Personalized Portlet

Introduce enhancements in the Personalized Portlet.

Ensure you have properly followed the steps in [Create a content spot](pzn_demo_create_content_spot.md).

We need a few more things in this portlet to make it interesting:

- User profiling  
- Special userid handling, so we can build the user profiles  
- A more complex binding rule  
- A dynamic HTML table, to display any number of special offers
