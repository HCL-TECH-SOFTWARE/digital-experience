# Enhancing the Personalized portlet

You can further improve the Personalized portlet by introducing specific enhancements. Before you begin, ensure you have properly followed the steps in [Create a content spot](pzn_demo_create_content_spot.md).

You can make the Personalized portlet more interesting with the following enhancements:

- User profiling  
- Special userid handling to be able to build user profiles  
- A more complex binding rule  
- A dynamic HTML table to display any number of special offers  

In the next topic, you will earn how to implement the first enhancement, [Inserting the dynamic table HTML/JSP code.](./pzn_demo_insert_dynamic_table_code.md)
