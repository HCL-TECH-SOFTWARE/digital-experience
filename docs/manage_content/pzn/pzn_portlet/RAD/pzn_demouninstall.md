# 18. Uninstall Personalization sample and database

In this topic, you will learn how to uninstall the Personalization sample demo, database, and users.

1. From a command prompt, navigate to wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine.

2. From this command prompt, run the following commands:

    - UNIX™Linux™:  
        `./ConfigEngine.sh remove-pzndemo -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password>`  
        `./ConfigEngine.sh remove-pzndemo-users -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password>`  

    - Windows™:  
        `ConfigEngine.bat remove-pzndemo -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password>`  
        `ConfigEngine.bat remove-pzndemo-users -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password>`  


!!!note
    The database connection to the included Apache Derby database may stay open and prevent removal of the database directory. Restart HCL Digital Experience and run `ConfigEngine.bat/sh remove-pzndemo-database -DPortalAdminPwd=<password> -DWasPassword=<password>` if this is a problem. The directory PznDemo in the root of the Portal Personalization Workspace may need to be removed manually.
