# 10. Creating a content spot

Use the Personalization Editor to create a placeholder for the rule that renders the selected content on a Web page. This placeholder is the content spot. Specify which rule to place in the content spot; this is called mapping the rule to the content spot or creating a rule mapping. In this example, the content is a resource collection.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure you have created the simple content rule **Show Gold Offers** for the Personalized Offers resource collection.

!!!note
    You must use the same name as the original content spot's display name. Do not place the new content spots into a folder, unless your display name already includes slashes. Place them directly into the root Workspace.

1. Return to the root directory in the Personalization Navigator.

2. Click **New > Content Spot** to display the Personalization Editor.

3. Type **Pzn_offersÂ spot** in the title field of the content spot.

4. Select **Pzn_offers** from the **Output Type** drop-down list.

5. Click the button in the **Default Mapping** section.

6. Expand the **Pers Offers** folder in the tree, select **Show Gold Offers** and click **OK**.

    !!!note
        If the previous values appear on the Preview tab, the rule and content spot work.

9. View the page with your Pers_Offers portlet.

You can now edit the JSP file to contain dynamic code.
