# Developing a personalized portlet using IBM Rational Application Developer

This section aims to help developers use the Personalization API to fully personalize the experience of DX users with a personalization portlet.
It supplements the [PZNDemo](../demo/index.md) with an additional JSP portlet that will be developed in IBM Rational Application Developer to show personalized offerings to users based on defined rules and content spots.
