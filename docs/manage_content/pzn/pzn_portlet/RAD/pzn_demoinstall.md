# 2. Installing the PZNDemo resources

In this exercise, the Portal Personalization sample resources (demo users, derby database, pages) are installed. No additional database requirements are needed.

1. Please follow the steps of the topic [Installing the PZNDemo resources](../demo/pzn_demoinstall.md) to install the Portal Personalization sample and to configure the database for the sample.  

    !!!note  
        The Personalization Offers (Pers_Offers) sample discussed in the next steps is an enhancement of the PZNDemo for which these resources need to be created first.  

2. Stop the HCL DX server. This action is necessary to free the single connection to the Derby database, so you can continue the next steps in this exercise.

The sample demo and database configuration is complete. You can now begin coding a basic personalized portlet.
