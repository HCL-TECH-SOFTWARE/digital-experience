# Profile rule element

Profile is an arbitrary name \(of your choice\) that provides information about the Web site visitor, the date and time the visit occurs, or other circumstances or conditions.

To better understand profiles, consider an example. Suppose you want to differentiate your Web visitors according to whether they are able to view confidential information. You might use two profiles in this scenario: Confidential and Regular.

When you create a profile within a profiler, type an arbitrary, but descriptive name. Be as accurate as possible to avoid duplication or confusion with other profiles. When selecting a profile \(for example, within a binding\), you choose from a list of available profile names that match the profiler rule.
