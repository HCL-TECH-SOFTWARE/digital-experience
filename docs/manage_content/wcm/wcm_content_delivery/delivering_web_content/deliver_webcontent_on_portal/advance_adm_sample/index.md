# Advanced administrative examples

You can undertake advanced administration for web content artifacts, such as web content pages and content associations.


-   **[Creating a web content page with the XML configuration interface](mp_wcm_createpagexml.md)**  
As with other portal pages, you can create a web content page with the XML configuration interface \(xmlaccess command\). Page definition is similar to a standard portal page. However, there is an additional page parameter that specifies the site area that is associated with the web content page.
-   **[Content associations reference](../advance_adm_sample/contentmap/index.md)**  
Content associations are used to associate web content pages with your web content site structure. When you select a folder to associate with a web content page, a content association is created and maintained within the portal.
-   **[Dynamic web content page selection](mp_wcm_dynamicpage.md)**  
The web content viewer provides a link broadcasting feature that dynamically determines the best web content page to use when rendering the linked content item. To perform this page selection, the viewer uses the content associations on the web content page.
