---




As a taxonomy evolves, you are required to edit your taxonomy by copying categories from one section of your taxonomy to another. You use the **Copy** feature to copy a category in a taxonomy.

1.  Browse to a category list.

2.  Select a category.

3.  Click **Copy**.

4.  Select a library.

5.  Select a taxonomy or a category to copy the category under. Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children you can still browse down to select them.

6.  Click **OK**.


!!! note
    The children of an item are not copied when you copy an item. You must copy any children separately.
