title: Moving a site area
---




As your site framework evolves, you are required to edit your site framework by moving site areas from one section of your site framework to another. You use the **Move** feature to change the position of a site area in the site framework. When you reposition a parent site area, any child site areas and related content are also moved.

1.  Browse to a site area list.

2.  Select a site area.

3.  Click **Move**.

4.  Select a library.

5.  Select a site area:

    1.  Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children, you can still browse to select them.

    2.  If the selected site area has existing children, you then select how to add the new site area:

        -   Select **First child** to move the site area as the first listed site area. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Last child** to move the site area as the last listed site area. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Before specified child** to move the site area before a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
        -   Select **After specified child** to move the site area after a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
