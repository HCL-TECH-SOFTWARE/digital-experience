    The basic home page is designed for content authors who need to create content items and other simple item types only. Content authors would not usually need access to the more advanced library explorer. The basic home page allows the creation of content by using up to six different authoring templates. The authoring templates that are displayed are the favorites of the current user, the most recently used by the current user, and any predefined authoring templates.

-   **Standard home page**

    One section of the standard home page is used to create items and open favorite locations. Another section of the standard home page is used to view recent activity. This interface is designed for content authors who need to complete tasks such as creating content, editing their draft content and approving and declining content. Content authors would not usually need access to the more advanced library explorer.
