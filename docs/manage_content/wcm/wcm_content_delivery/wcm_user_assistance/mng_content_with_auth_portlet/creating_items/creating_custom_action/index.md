# Creating a custom action


A custom action is used to run a custom workflow action based on a Java class you previously created and added to your system.

Before you create a custom workflow action, you must create a custom workflow class.

To create a custom action, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management** and then click **New** \> **Workflow Actions** \> **Custom Action**.
