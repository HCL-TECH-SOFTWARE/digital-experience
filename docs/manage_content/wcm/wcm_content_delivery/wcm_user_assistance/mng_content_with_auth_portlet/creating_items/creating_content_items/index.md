# Creating content items


Content items are based on authoring templates. The fields that are displayed in a content item form can be hidden from different users, so not all of the following steps might be required. Some fields and elements might already contain default data.

1.  To create a content item, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management**, click **New** \> **Content**, and then select an authoring template. The content form is opened.


1.  [Entering identification information](wcm_dev_items_id_content.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Adding elements to an item](wcm_dev_elements_adding_content.md)  
You add elements to site areas, content items, page items, and authoring templates to store web content specific to those items.
3.  [Entering content item properties](wcm_dev_items_props_content.md)  
Specify properties for the current item, including an alternative presentation template and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item.
4.  [Entering profile information](wcm_dev_profiling_items_content.md)  
Specify the profile information that is used to identify the current item, such as the categories to which the item belongs and any keywords that you want to associate with the item.
5.  [Selecting a workflow](wcm_dev_workflow_items_content.md)  
The workflow section is only visible on item types that are enabled to use a workflow. Only content items, and site areas not based on the default site area template, are enabled by default.
6.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](wcm_dev_items_access_content.md)  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
7.  [Specifying the location of a content item](wcm_dev_content_location.md)  
When you first create a content item, you are required to specify the location of the item if the location is not defined in the authoring template.
