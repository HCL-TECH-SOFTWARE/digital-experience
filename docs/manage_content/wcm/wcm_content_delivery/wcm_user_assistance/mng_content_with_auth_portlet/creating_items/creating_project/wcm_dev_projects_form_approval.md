title: Defining project approval settings
---




If you want a project to be reviewed before it is published, you must select at least one approver in the approval section.

1.  Click **Add** to select the users that are responsible for reviewing the project.

2.  Define the approval requirements for the project:

    1.  Select **All Approvers** if approval is needed by all approvers for the project to be ready to be published.

    2.  Select **Any Approver** if approval is needed by only one approver for the project to be ready to be published.

3.  Select **Require a comment from the approver** if you want to enforce the recording of a comment when the project is approved.


**Note:** The approvers that are selected here apply only to the project itself, not to the items added to the project. Item approval is defined separately on each item.
