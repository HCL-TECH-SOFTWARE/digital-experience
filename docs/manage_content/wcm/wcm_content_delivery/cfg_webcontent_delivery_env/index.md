# Configuring a web content delivery environment

Set up your delivery environment by installing web content viewers and enabling any other required features.

-   **[Setting up site analysis for the Web Content Viewer](../wcm/wcm_config_wcmviewer_sitean.md)**  
To track usage data for the Web Content Viewer, you can configure the portal for site analysis logging for the Web Content Viewer.
-   **[XML configuration interface parameters for the Web Content Viewer](../wcm/wcm_config_wcmviewer_xmlaccess.md)**  
As with other portlets in your portal, you can use the XML configuration interface \(xmlaccess command\) to deploy and configure the Web Content Viewer. To simplify the configuration of the portlet with the XML configuration interface, the portlet parameters you can specify accept path values in addition to the standard IDs.
-   **[Caching options](../wcm/wcm_config_delivery_caching.md)**  
Both HCL Web Content Manager generated web pages and content from external data sources can be cached by the Web Content Manager application. If used correctly, Web Content Manager caching can dramatically increase the performance of a site.
-   **[Pre-rendering options](../wcm/wcm_config_delivery_pre-rendered_enable.md)**  
You can enable pre-rendering so that content can be viewed either through an HCL Web Content Manager application or as a stand-alone site that is accessed through a web server.
