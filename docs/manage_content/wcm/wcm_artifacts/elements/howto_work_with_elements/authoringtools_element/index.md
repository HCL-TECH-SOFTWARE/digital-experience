# Authoring Tools Element

The authoring tool element is used to add authoring portlet functions to web pages. When you create an authoring tool element, you need to define the layout of the authoring tool and any required actions, and select parameters for each action layout as required.

When rendering authoring tool components in the Web Content Viewer, you must account for some changes in the way placeholder tags are specified and in the way users browse to pages that contain authoring tool components. Authoring tasks that are accessed through a Web Content Viewer, such as inline editing, require the use of an instance of the HCL Web Content Manager authoring portlet that is reserved specifically for such tasks.
-   **[How to reference an authoring tool](../../howto_work_with_elements/authoringtools_element/wcm_dev_elements_authoring-tools_referencing.md)**  
An authoring tool component can be referenced within presentation templates, menu component designs, navigator component designs, and personalization component designs. When added to menus, navigators, or personalization component designs, the edit and delete functions are applied to each displayed item.
