You can use a Personalization element only by creating a Personalization component. You cannot add a Personalization element to authoring templates, site areas, or content items.

To create a Personalization component, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management** and then click **New** \> **Component** \> **Personalization**.

1.  [Entering identification information](wcm_dev_items_id_pzncmpt.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Specifying a location for an item](wcm_dev_items_location_pzncmpt.md)  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Defining a Personalization rule](wcm_dev_elements_pzn_props.md)  
You use the Personalization element to define a new personalization rule or select an existing personalization rule or content spot.
4.  [Entering item properties](wcm_dev_items_props_pzncmpt.md)  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
5.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](wcm_dev_items_access_pzncmpt.md)  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
