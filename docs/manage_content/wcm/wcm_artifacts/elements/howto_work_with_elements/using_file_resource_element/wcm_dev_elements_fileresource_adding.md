title: Adding a file resource element to an item
---




You add a file resource element to a site area or content item when you want the file resource to be used for a specific site area or content item.

**Note:** You can add an element to a content item only if the manage elements feature is enabled in the authoring template that is used by the content item.

1.  Open or create a site area, site area template, content item, or content template.

2.  Click **Manage Elements**.

3.  Select **File** as the element type.

4.  Enter a name. Do not use double-byte and non-ASCII characters.

5.  Enter a display title to use as the title of the element displayed indexes and forms.

6.  If you have created a text provider plug-in for a multi-locale site, you can also select the text provider and enter a key to look up a string from the selected text provider. The text provider displays a different display title for each language it is configured for. The text that is entered in the **Display Title** field is only used if an appropriate display title is not available from the selected text provider, or if the text provider is not available.

7.  Click **Add**. The file resource element is added to your form.

8.  Go to the file resource element you created.

9.  Click **Upload a file** to select a file to store in the file resource component.

    **Note:** In CF06 or higher, click **Upload** to upload a file, or click **Select** to select a component. Selecting a component is useful if you need to store a file in a different library, or apply different access settings to the original file resource component. You can select a component only if this option is enabled for the file resource element in the authoring template that is used by the content item or site area.

10. Save the item form.

11. To choose a different file click **Replace**.

12. To remove the file click **Remove**.
