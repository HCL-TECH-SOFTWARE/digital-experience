# Image Element

You store an image in an image element.

When you store an image in an image element:

-   You can reference the image anywhere in your site regardless of the original file location or URL.
-   The image is automatically transferred to other servers during syndication.
-   You can reference the image element within other items as required.

## Creating an image element

To create an image element, you can either add an image element to an authoring template, site area or content item, or create an image component.

!!!note
    Images with names that include non-ascii characters cannot be pre-rendered. If you are pre-rendering a site, you must rename the image before you add it to the image element.

## Valid mime types

You can configure which mime types are valid for an image element by editing the `imageresourcecmpnt.allowedmimetypes` setting. See [Web content authoring options](../../../../wcm_content_delivery/cfg_webcontent_auth_env/wcm_config_prop_authoring.md) for further information.
