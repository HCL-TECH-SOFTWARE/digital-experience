Create a website by, building templates, and specifying other key components of the system. When these items are in place, you can begin adding elements to your templates and use them to create content items.

Each content item that you create contains at least one element type. The elements that are stored in a content item are determined by the authoring template that is selected when you created the content item. Depending on the authoring template, and your level of access, you might also be able to manage the elements in a content item.
