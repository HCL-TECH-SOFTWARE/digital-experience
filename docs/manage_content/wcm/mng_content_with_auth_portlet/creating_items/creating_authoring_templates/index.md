# Creating authoring templates

An authoring template is used to define the default authoring settings for site areas and content items. These settings include the design of the authoring form, what fields and elements appear on the authoring form, and default values for fields and elements. You must create authoring templates before you create site areas and content items.

-   **[Creating a site area template](../creating_authoring_templates/creating_sitearea_template/index.md)**  
Create a site area template to configure the design of the authoring form and determine what elements can be included in the form.
-   **[Creating a content template](../creating_authoring_templates/creating_content_template/index.md)**  
Create a content template to configure the design of the authoring form and determine what elements can be included in the form.
-   **[Defining display settings of fields and elements](wcm_dev_auth-temp_fields.md)**  
You can define the display properties of field and elements that are displayed on a content form. Different field and element types have different display properties.
-   **[Selecting the digital asset source for image and file elements](dam_wcm_select.md)**  
When you add a resource to an authoring template, you can define how the resource is selected when a content item is created.
-   **[Customizing elements with JSP](wcm_dev_custom_jsp.md)**  
A "custom JSP" field is available on some element types when added to an authoring template. You use this field to reference a JSP file to use instead of the element default view in the user interface. You can write JSP to control the design of an element, and to restrict the values that can be entered into an element.
-   **[Previewing an authoring template](wcm_dev_auth-temp_preview.md)**  
Preview the authoring template to view how the item form appears to the user. You can also test any settings that need validation when the form is submitted, such as a valid workflow or required element values.
