You use a rich text element to provide users with a rich text editor that can be used to author a section of HTML. To create a rich text element, you can either add a rich text element to an authoring template, site area, or content item, or create a rich text component.

-   **[Creating a rich text component](wcm_dev_elements_rich-text_creating.md)**  
You create a rich text component when you want to reuse a section of HTML in multiple places in your website, and you want to use a rich text editor to create and edit the HTML. A copyright notice is an example of the kind of HTML you might store in a rich text component.
-   **[Adding a rich text element to an item](wcm_dev_elements_rich-text_adding.md)**  
You add a rich text element to a site area or content item when you want a section of HTML to be used for a specific site area or content item and you want to use a rich text editor to create and edit the section of HTML.
-   **[Adding a rich text element to a template](wcm_dev_elements_rich-text_add_template.md)**
