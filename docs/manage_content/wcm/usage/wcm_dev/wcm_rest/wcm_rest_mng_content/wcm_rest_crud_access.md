# How to use REST with access controls

The access control section in an Atom entry or JSON entry that is generated by the REST service for Web Content Manager links to resources from the Portal Access Control REST API.

An example of how the access controls are displayed:

```
<link rel="access-control" 
href="/wps/mycontenthandler/!ut/p/digest!ZXqvndUckPlBBgMoHkgcCA/ac/
access:oid:Z6QReDeOHP0JQK62BO4JM462RO6JMG64JC2JM07K1D6JM07MHCE3QKCH1D86I9633"/>
```

You can send a GET request to the URI and obtain the access control information of an item that is generated by the [Portal Access Control REST API](../dev/pacrestapi.md).
