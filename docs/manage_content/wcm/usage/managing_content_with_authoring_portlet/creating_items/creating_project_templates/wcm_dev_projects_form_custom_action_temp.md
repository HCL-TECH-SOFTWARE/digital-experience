You can apply custom workflow actions to the different states of a project. These actions can be used to trigger different actions during the life of a project. The actions are run when a project enters a state that the action is assigned to.

1.  Select groups or users that have editor or viewer access for this section by default in any projects that are created by using this project template.

    You can choose to hide this section from projects that use this project template so that it is only visible to administrators and users who have viewer or editor access. If no editors or viewers are selected, all users have access to this section.

2.  To add a custom action, click **Add**.

3.  Select a custom action and click **OK**.

4.  Select which project state this action is applied to.
