# Delivering web content on a DX page

Using tools like Web Content Viewer Portlets, content associations, and web content page templates, you can build DX pages and display web content. You can also combine web content with other portlet-based content. Content associations tie viewers and DX pages to the site structure of your web content libraries.

You can customize your portal delivery as well. Examples include:

-   Creating your own web content page templates
-   Deploying pre-configured Web Content Viewers
-   Providing convenience features like customized error messages and friendly URLs
