# Delivering web content

HCL Digital Experience (DX) has a highly configurable system for delivering web content. This includes both headless content delivery to other clients like mobile apps and direct rendering of websites via HCL DX. For more information about how to use HCL DX to build websites, refer to [Build Sites](../../build_sites/index.md).

## What is it For?

The type of delivery method you use to deliver web content to your viewers depend on the type of content that is being delivered, and the type of viewers your website is intended for. This section describes the options for that.

## Who Should Use It?

This information is primarily aimed at system administrators and application developers who would must configure web content delivery.

-   **[Vanity URLs](./vanity_url/index.md)**  
You can use Vanity URLs, also known as marketing URLs, to create shorter URLs that people can easily type and remember.
-   **[Syndication](./syndication/index.md)**  
You can use syndication to replicate web content library data from one server to another. Syndication is based on a syndicator and subscriber relationship, where the syndicator has the current data and the subscriber receives the data.
-   **[WebDAV](./webdav/index.md)**  
Using WebDAV, you can use standard operating system tools to create, modify, and delete web content rather than using the standard authoring portlet.
-   **[Content as a Service pages](./content_as_a_service/index.md)**  
You can use Content as a Service (CaaS) pages in HCL Digital Experience (DX) to render content managed by your HCL Web Content Manager (WCM) in different data formats such as JSON or XML. CaaS pages also allows the content in your website to be accessed by other data clients in raw data formats.
-   **[Previewing as another user](./preview_another_user/index.md)**  
Using the preview capability, you can quickly check changes to your website without having to log in and out as another user. You can view specific changes to users with varying access levels, including unauthenticated users.
-   **[Social Media Publisher](./socialmedia_publisher/index.md)**  
Using Social Media Publisher for HCL WCM, businesses can promote their web content on social networks and provide basic statistics about the promoted content.
-   **[Access web content by using a servlet](./wcm_config_delivery_servlet.md)**  
Users can access content displayed using the WCM servlet by connecting to a URL. A servlet-delivered website is used when you do not need to use any HCL DX based features such as authoring tools.
-   **[Rendering modes for web content](./wcm_rendering_modes.md)**  
Different presentation templates are created to render web content in different modes to display content in different contexts, such as a web content viewer portlet, or mobile devices.
-   **[Delivering web content on a DX page](../wcm_delivery/deliver_webcontent_on_dx/index.md)**  
Using tools like Web Content Viewer Portlets, content associations, and web content page templates, you can build portal pages and display web content. You can also combine web content with other portlet-based content. Content associations tie viewers and portal pages to the site structure of your web content libraries.
-   **[Pre-rendered delivery](../wcm_delivery/pre-rendered_delivery/index.md)**  
You can pre-render a complete HCL WCM site into HTML and save it to disk. The pre-rendered site can then be used as your live site and displayed to users that use WCM or a web server. You deploy a pre-rendered site when you are not using any HCL DX features and your content is static and only updated periodically.
