# Monitor syndication

After you set up a syndication relationship, you can monitor the progress of data replication between syndicators and subscribers.

## Test the syndication connection

To test whether your syndicator and subscriber can connect to each other, click **Test Connection**. If the connection fails, investigate the cause.

## Monitor syndicator and subscriber status

You can monitor the status of individual syndicators and subscribers:

* [Manage syndicators and subscribers](../manage_synd_subs/wcm_syndication_monitoring/wcm_syndication.md)  
  Use syndication to transfer data between HCL Web Content Manager instances.

   * [Manage pending items](../manage_synd_subs/wcm_syndication_monitoring/wcm_syndication_pending.md)  
     After you configure a syndication relationship, monitor pending items on a syndicator. Pending items are items updated since the last syndication.

   * [Manage failed items](../manage_synd_subs/wcm_syndication_monitoring/wcm_syndication_failed.md)  
     Sometimes items fail to syndicate. Use the failed items view to review them and re-run syndication after you resolve the issues.
