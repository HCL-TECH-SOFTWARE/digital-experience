# Monitor syndication

After you set up a syndication relationship, you can monitor the progress of data replication between syndicators and subscribers.

## Test the syndication connection

To test whether your syndicator and subscriber can connect to each other, click **Test Connection**. If the connection fails, investigate the cause.

## Monitor syndicator and subscriber status

You can monitor the status of individual syndicators and subscribers:

* [Manage syndicators and subscribers](../wcm_syndication_monitoring/wcm_syndication.md)  
  Use syndication to transfer data between HCL Web Content Manager instances.

   * [Manage pending items](../wcm_syndication_monitoring/wcm_syndication_pending.md)  
     Pending items are those updated on the syndicator since the last syndication.

   * [Manage failed items](../wcm_syndication_monitoring/wcm_syndication_failed.md)  
     Sometimes items fail to syndicate. Use the failed items view to review them and re-run syndication after you resolve the issues.
