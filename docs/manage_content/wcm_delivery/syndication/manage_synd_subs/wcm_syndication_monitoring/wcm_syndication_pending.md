# Managing pending items

After you set up a syndication relationship, you can monitor pending items on a syndicator. Pending items are items updated on the syndicator since the last syndication.

1.  Log on to your syndicator as an administrator.

2.  Go to **Administration** > **Portal Content** > **Syndicators**.

3.  To review a list of pending items for a syndicator, click the **Pending Items** icon.
