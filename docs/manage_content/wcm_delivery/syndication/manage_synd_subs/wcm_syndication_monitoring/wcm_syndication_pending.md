# Managing Pending Items 

After you set up a syndication relationship, you can monitor pending items on a syndicator. Pending items are items that have been updated on the syndicator since the last syndication.

1. Sign in to your syndicator as an administrator.
2. Go to **Administration > Portal Content > Syndicators**.
3. Select the **Pending Items** icon to view the list of pending items for the syndicator.
