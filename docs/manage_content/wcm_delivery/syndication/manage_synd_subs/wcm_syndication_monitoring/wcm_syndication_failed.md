# Managing Failed Items

Occasionally, items fail to syndicate. Use the failed items view to review the list and re-run syndication after you fix the issue.

1. Sign in to your syndicator as an administrator.
2. Go to **Administration > Portal Content > Syndicators**.
3. Find the number of failed items in the **Failed Items** column, and select the number to open the failed items view.

The failed items view shows each failed item for the selected syndicator and provides details to help you fix each issue.

The **Root** and **Impact** columns help identify the root cause of a syndication failure and any secondary items it affects. Fixing the root cause often resolves failures of the impacted items.

You can also use the **Important Items** tab to prioritize the critical items.

After you fix the issues:
- Select **Retry** to initiate syndication for individual items.
- Or select **Retry All** in the **Important Items** tab to syndicate all failed items.
- You can also update or rebuild a syndication relationship.
