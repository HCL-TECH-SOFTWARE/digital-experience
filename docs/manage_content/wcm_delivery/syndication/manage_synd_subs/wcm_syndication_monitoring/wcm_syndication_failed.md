# Managing failed items

Occasionally, items fail to syndicate. Use the failed items view to review the list and re-run syndication once the issue is fixed.

1.  Log on to your syndicator as an administrator.

2.  Go to **Administration** > **Portal Content** > **Syndicators**.

3.  The number of failed items for a syndicator appears in the **Failed Items** column. Click the number of failed items to open the **Failed Items** view.
    * The **Failed Items** view displays each failed item for the selected syndicator. It provides information for fixing each issue.
    * The **Root** and **Impact** columns help you identify the root cause of a syndication failure and any secondary items it impacts. Fixing the root cause often resolves the failures of impacted items.
    * You can also use the **Important Items** tab to prioritize crucial items.

4.  After you fix the issues, click **Retry** to initiate syndication for individual items. Alternatively, use **Retry All** in the **Important Items** tab to syndicate all failed items. You can also update or rebuild a syndication relationship.
