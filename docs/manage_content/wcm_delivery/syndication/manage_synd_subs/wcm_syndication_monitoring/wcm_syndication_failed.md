Sometimes items fail to syndicate. Use the Failed Items view to review failed items and retry syndication after you fix the issues.


1. Log on to your syndicator as an administrator.


2. Go to **Administration** > **Portal Content** > **Syndicators**.


3. In the **Failed Items** column, view the number of failed items. Click the number to open the Failed Items view.


   - Review each failed item, including details about how to fix the issue.
   - Use the **Root** and **Impact** columns to identify the root cause and see which secondary items are affected. Fixing the root cause can often resolve related failures.
   - Use the **Important Items** tab to focus on the most critical items.


4. After you fix the issues, retry syndication:
   - Click **Retry** to syndicate individual items.
   - Click **Retry All** in the Important Items tab to retry all failed items.
   - You can also choose to update or rebuild the syndication relationship.
