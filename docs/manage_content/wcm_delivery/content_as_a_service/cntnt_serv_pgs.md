# Content as a Service pages

Starting with version 8.5 CF05, HCL Digital Experience introduces the concept of Content as a Service pages. The Content as a Service pages can be used to render content that is managed by your HCL Web Content Manager in different data formats.

Individual representations of your web content can be generated by using the corresponding HCL Web Content Manager presentation components. Instead of generating HTML, the HCL Web Content Manager presentation components can be used to generate representations of your web content in formats of your choice for example, JSON, or XML. Content as a Service pages allow the content that is centrally authored and maintained on your website, to be accessed by the other data clients in raw data formats. Those data clients can generate their own client-specific visualization of the data. This approach of generating data is especially useful in mobile application that might want to present the content consistent with the other parts of the application.
