# Accessing the Content Reporting portlet

This section provides steps on how to access the HCL Content Reporting portlet and details on how each report criterion is interpreted.

## Prerequisite

Starting from HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF214, Content Reporting is installed and deployed by default as part of the CF update process. However, for CF213, Content Reporting must be installed and configured.

After image configuration in your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF213 deployment, Content Reporting is accessible from the Practitioner Studio interface.
