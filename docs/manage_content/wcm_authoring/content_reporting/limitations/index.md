# Limitations

Take note of the following limitations when using HCL Content Reporting:

## Generating a report

- For the **Expiry date** criteria, no results are returned if the same date is used in the **From** and **To** fields.
- For the **Word** criteria, a dash (-) is considered a delimiter for splitting the text entered. For example, if you search for "AT-Product-Item", results are returned for three different words: AT, Product, and Item.
- After generating a report, there is no option to sort using certain fields such as **Location**, **Status**, **Type**, **Expires on**, **Owners**, and **Authors**.

## Using the Bulk Updates feature

-   The bulk updates feature has been tested to work with a maximum of 5000 items. Working with items more than this amount might lead to performance issues. It is recommended to avoid using the Derby database when working with more than 500 items because it may lead to performance degradation.
-   The bulk updates feature does not have project scope (HCL Digital Experience Projects) capabilities.
-   Only the following actions are currently available:
    - Update the expiration date of content items
    - Add, remove, and replace owners and authors of content items
-   When updating expiration dates, updates can only be applied in bulk to content items, site areas, authoring templates, components, categories, and items with Edit access.
-   When updating expiration dates, items that are not assigned a workflow are excluded from the updates.
-   When updating expiration dates, you can only select a date and the default time is 12:00 a.m.
-   When updating owners or authors, updates cannot be applied in bulk to Libraries.
-   The status of bulk update requests is not tracked in real-time; the status is updated every 10 seconds.
-   Selecting a subset of items in the report for update is not allowed.

## Exporting reports to a CSV file

-   The CSV export function uses the browser's blob storage. If a large CSV export is attempted, users might encounter out-of-memory errors with the browser. This prevents the successful download of any large file.
-   Selecting a subset of items in the report for export is not allowed.

## Bookmarking reports

-  The bookmarked URL from HCL Content Reporting does not function in a non-authenticated user session. You must log in first to your Digital Experience account before you can access the bookmarked URL.
-   When you go to a bookmarked report and then change the language using the language switcher, the system fails to retain the report and redirects you to the HCL Content Reporting landing page.

## User interface

Note that the following pages do not support server-side pages, which might cause an unstable UI when processing large amounts of data.
