# Bookmarking a generated report

Starting CF217, content managers can bookmark reports generated using HCL Content Reporting.

## Prerequisite

Beginning with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 release update CF214, Content Reporting is enabled by default. For HCL Digital Experience 9.5 release update CF213, Content Reporting should be installed and configured. For instructions on installing Content Reporting manually on supported environments, see the [Installing HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Content Reporting](../installation/index.md) topic.

## Bookmarking a report

Refer to the following steps to bookmark a generated report:

1.  Log in to your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 platform and select **Web Content**, then select **Content Reporting** from the Practitioner Studio navigator.

2. Create a report on search items you want to bookmark. See the [Generating a content report](../usage/generate_content_report.md) for further instructions.

3. After generating a report, you can bookmark the page in your browser or copy the URL in the address bar to share the report.

## Automatic refresh in reports

Reports automatically reload when you switch tabs and then return to the **Content Reporting** tab.
