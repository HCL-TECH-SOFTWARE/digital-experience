# HCL Content Reporting

The Content Reporting application allows content managers to generate reports and make updates on the reported items in bulk (for example, track and change expiry dates).

Content reporting is for, but not limited to, the following sample use cases:

- For tracking expiring items and making a plan for updating them.
- For exporting generated reports to CSV to:
    - transform the report into graphs or charts.
    - analyze the data in the report through other tools in combination with other sources of data.
