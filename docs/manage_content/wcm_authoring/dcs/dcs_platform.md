# Supported Operating Systems for DCS

Some operating systems support running the DCS locally while others do not. The following table lists the operating systems and versions that support running the document conversion services for HCL Portal version CF204 and earlier, HCL Portal installations upgraded from CF203 or CF204, and HCL Portal installations upgraded after [manually backing up the Oracle Stellent files](./dcs_backup.md). On operating systems that do not support running the DCS locally, document conversion must be done on a remote IBM WebSphere Application Server that supports document conversion services. In HCL Portal version CF205 and later, DX Document Conversion Services is automatically configured to use HCL supported functions. The third-party component, which was supplied by Oracle is no longer included.

The following operating systems are supported by DCS.
