# Managing web content libraries

As an administrator you need to periodically assist content managers with library maintenance, such as disabling or deleting a library.

!!!important
    Some library tasks can reduce the performance of your server while they are running. Therefore, schedule library maintenance to occur during off-peak periods when the least number of users are accessing a library.

-   **[Creating web content libraries](wcm_config_wcmlibraries.md)**  
Administrator users can create web content libraries in the HCL Digital Experience administration portlet.
-   **[Deleting a web content library](wcm_config_wcmlibrary_delete.md)**  
When a web content library is no longer required, you can delete the library.
-   **[Disabling a web content library](wcm_config_wcmlibrary_disable.md)**  
When a web content library is no longer required, you can disable the library.
-   **[Unlocking a library](wcm_admin_library_unlock.md)**  
A library can become locked when a long running task, such as restoring all content items in a library, fails to unlock the library.
-   **[Defining roles within a library](wcm_configure_library_role.md)**  
You can define the access of a user or group for a library to determine who has access to a library, and to define access within the authoring portlet.
-   **[Restoring items in a library](wcm_managing_versions_library.md)**  
You can restore a set of items within a library that either have the same label or were versioned at, or before, a specified date and time.
-   **[Labeling a set of items in a library](wcm_managing_labels.md)**  
You can apply a label to the most recent versions of all items in a library. This action does not create a version, it updates the label of the most recent version. If you created a label, you can later restore items in the library based on that label.
-   **[Setting root access for all web content libraries](wcm_config_library_root_access.md)**  
Learn how to set root access for all HCL Digital Experience web content libraries using the web content authoring portlet.
