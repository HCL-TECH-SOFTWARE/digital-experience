# Presentation Designer

With Presentation Designer, you can edit presentation templates through a drag-and-drop interface, following a low-code/no-code approach. You can style and configure elements with a real-time, visual editing experience, where changes are instantly reflected on the canvas.

Presentation Designer is ideal for, but not limited to, the following sample use cases:

-  Allowing content managers to edit and customize presentation templates without relying on developers.
-  Reducing editorial friction by enabling content managers to design and manage presentation templates independently.
-  Simplifying the creation process for web content layouts by offering a visual interface where users can drag and drop elements and instantly see the output in real-time on the canvas.
-  Enabling an interactive design experience, minimizing the need for users to preview the final output separately as changes are immediately visible on the canvas.
-  Generating HTML markup automatically from the designs created in Presentation Designer, ensuring that the final output is ready to be used in websites without further manual coding.
