# Presentation Designer

With Presentation Designer, you can edit presentation templates through a drag-and-drop interface, following a low-code/no-code approach. You can style and configure elements with a real-time, visual editing experience, where changes are instantly reflected on the canvas.

Presentation Designer is ideal for, but not limited to, the following sample use cases:

-  Allowing content managers to edit and customize presentation templates without relying on developers.
-  Reducing editorial friction by enabling content managers to design and manage presentation templates independently.
-  Simplifying the creation process for web content layouts by offering a visual interface where users can drag and drop elements and instantly see the output in real-time on the canvas.
-  Enabling an interactive design experience, minimizing the need for users to preview the final output separately as changes are immediately visible on the canvas.
-  Generating HTML markup automatically from the designs created in Presentation Designer, ensuring that the final output is ready to be used in websites without further manual coding.

By using Presentation Designer, content managers can reduce their reliance on developers to assemble presentation templates for their content. This intuitive approach mirrors the capabilities found in modern website creation tools, helping content managers to create new sites and assets on their own and reduce the editorial friction they experience.
