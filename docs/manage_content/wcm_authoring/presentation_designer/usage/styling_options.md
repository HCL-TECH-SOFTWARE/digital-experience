# Styling options in Presentation Designer

Styling options allow users to make the elements on the canvas presentable. Styles enable an interactive design experience that lets users see their style changes reflected on the canvas in real-time. This topic outlines the different styling options you can do in the **Style** panel of Presentation Designer.
