# Styling options in Presentation Designer

Styling options allow users to make the elements on the canvas presentable. Styles enable an interactive design experience that lets users see their style changes reflected on the canvas in real-time. This topic outlines the different styling options you can do in the **Style** panel of Presentation Designer.

To access Presentation Designer and understand its user interface, refer to the **[Access Presentation Designer](../access/index.md)** topic.

To learn how to use the different user elements in Presentation Designer, refer to the **[User Elements in Presentation Designer](../usage/user_elements.md)** topic. 


## Style panel

The styling options change based on the specific user element selected on the canvas. To check the available styling options for each element on your canvas, click an element and check the rendered style options in the **Style** panel.

See the following sample styling options for a static text element:

## Inline styles

In Presentation Designer, styling options are applied directly to the selected elements through inline styles.

## Style sections

Style sections in Presentation Designer refer to categorized areas where users can adjust specific style properties of the selected user element on the canvas. Each section focuses on a different aspect of an element's design, helping users navigate the **Style** panel and apply the adjustments they need for each element.

### Dimensions
The **Dimensions** section allows users to control the size and scaling of elements within the design, ensuring they fit well within their containers and across various screen sizes.

- **Width**: Adjusts the width of the selected element.
- **Height**: Adjusts the height of the selected element.
- **Min width**: Defines the minimum width the element can be resized to.
- **Min height**: Defines the minimum height the element can be resized to.
- **Max width**: Defines the maximum width the element can be resized to.
- **Max height**: Defines the maximum height the element can be resized to.

This section supports the following units and values:

- **Supported Units**: `px`, `vh`, `vw`, `%`, `calc()`  
- **Sample Values**: `200px`, `100vh`, `25%`, `calc(50vh - 10px)`, `auto`, `inherit`


### Spacing
**Spacing** properties allow users to control the space around and within elements, ensuring proper layout structure and distance between each element.

- **Margin**: Controls the space outside the element, determining how far an element is from adjacent ones.

This section supports the following units and values:

- **Supported Units**: `px`, `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw`, `%`, `calc()`  
- **Sample Values**: `10px`, `1em`, `2rem`, `5%`, `calc(10px + 2vw)`, `auto`


### Borders
The **Border** section allows users to customize the border around elements, enhancing their appearance and creating a clear visual structure.

- **Border style**: Specifies the element's border type. Possible values include solid, dashed, and dotted.

- **Border radius**: Controls the roundness of an element's corners.
    -  **Supported Units**: `px`, `em`, `rem`, `%`
    -  **Sample Values**: `5px`, `10px`, `1rem`, `50%`, `inherit`

    - **Sample Values**: `#FFFFFF`, `rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.2)`, `red`

- **Border width**: Sets the thickness of an element's border.
    - **Supported Units**: `px`, `em`, `rem`  
    - **Sample Values**: `1px`, `3em`, `0.1rem`


### Appearance
The **Appearance** section allows users to change the colors of elements to make them stand out or blend into the overall design.

- **Background color**: Changes the background color of the selected element.
    - **Sample Values**: `#FFFFFF`, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`, `blue`

- **Text color**: Changes the color of any text within the element.
    - **Sample Values**: `#000000`, `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`, `green`


### Layout
The **Layout** section allows users to control the structural positioning and setup of the grid element, ensuring proper arrangement and organization of content within rows and columns.

- **Rows**: Specifies the number of horizontal sections (rows) in the grid. The minimum value is `1` row. 
    - **Sample Values**: `1`, `2`, `3`

- **Columns**: Specifies the number of vertical sections (columns) in the grid. The minimum value is `1` column.  
    - **Sample Values**: `1`, `2`, `3`

- **Row Gap**: Defines the space between rows in the grid.  
    - **Supported Units**: `px`  
    - **Sample Values**: `10px`, `20px`

- **Column Gap**: Defines the space between columns in the grid.  
    - **Supported Units**: `px`  
    - **Sample Values**: `15px`, `25px`

- **Grid (Column and Row Setup)**: Defines how space is distributed within the grid using fractional units (`fr`) for columns and rows. This setup allows you to create equally proportioned grid layouts.

- **Grid Cell (Columns)**: Specifies the number of columns the grid cell will occupy.  
    - **Sample Values**: `1`, `2`, `3`

- **Grid Cell (Rows)**: Specifies the number of rows the grid cell will occupy.  
    - **Sample Values**: `1`, `2`, `3`


### Position
The **Position** section allows users to precisely control the placement of elements on the canvas, ensuring accurate positioning based on the layout's needs.

- **Object position**: Sets an elementâ€™s position relative to its parent or containing element. Possible values include static, relative, absolute, sticky, and fixed.

    Under **Object position**, you can also specify the exact placement of an element using the following properties:

      - **Top**: Specifies the distance between the top edge of the element and the top edge of its containing element.
      - **Bottom**: Specifies the distance between the bottom edge of the element and the bottom edge of its containing element.
      - **Left**: Specifies the distance between the left edge of the element and the left edge of its containing element.
      - **Right**: Specifies the distance between the right edge of the element and the right edge of its containing element.

        The **top, bottom, left, and right** properties supports the following units and values:

        **Supported Units**: `px`, `vh`, `vw`, `%`, `calc()`  
        **Sample Values**: `20px`, `10vh`, `15%`, `calc(10% + 5px)`, `auto`, `inherit`

- **Order of Elements**: Controls the stacking order of elements, determining which elements appear in front or behind other elements on the canvas. The following properties adjust the `z-index` style property to change the stacking order of the elements:
    - **Bring Forward**: Moves the selected element one layer up in the stacking order.
    - **Bring to Front**: Moves the selected element to the highest layer in the stacking order.
    - **Send Backward**: Moves the selected element one layer down in the stacking order.
    - **Send to Back**: Moves the selected element to the lowest layer in the stacking order.


### Typography

The **Typography** section allows users to customize text-based elements, giving them full control over the font, size, and styling of text. This ensures readability and alignment with design standards.

- **Capitalization**: Adjusts text to be uppercase, lowercase, or sentence case.

### Units of measurement
Refer to the following tips on selecting the appropriate unit of measurement for the properties you want to adjust.

- Use `px` for fixed and precise measurements such as button width or border thickness.
- Use `em` and `rem` for scalable layouts to allow text sizes to adjust proportionally while maintaining consistency.
- Use `%`, `vw`, and `vh` for responsive designs to enable elements to adjust based on the screen size or parent container dimensions.
- Use `calc()` for complex layouts that require dynamic calculations. For example, you can use this unit when combining fixed and flexible measurements.
- Use unitless values such as `none`, `inherit`, or `auto` for properties that don't require a specific unit.
- Use specific color values such as  `hex`, `rgba`, `rgb` for more precise color combinations. You can also use general color names such as `red`, `blue`, or `green`.
    - **`hex`**: Uses hex values for precise color definition. For example, you can use`#FFFFFF` for the color white.
    - **`rgb`**: Defines colors with red, green, and blue values. For example, you can enter `rgb(255, 99, 71)`.
    - **`rgba`**: Adds alpha transparency to colors. For example, use `rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)` for a semi-transparent color.
