# Default and Override Stylesheets in Presentation Designer

In Presentation Designer, stylesheets play a crucial role in defining the appearance and behavior of elements within a presentation. There are two types of stylesheets that work together to ensure flexibility and consistency in design: the **Default Stylesheet** and the **Override Stylesheet**. 

The **Default Stylesheet** provides a foundational set of styles that are automatically applied to various elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the presentation.

The following image shows how the default style options work in Presentation Designer.

1. From the initial render of the Presentation Designer, a default style will load.

2. After saving the Presentation Designer, it will automatically create a default style.

3. The default style can be located within the current libraries of the Presentation Designer.

4. The naming of the default style is: pd_default_stylesheet.

5. The default style has its own class name naming convention for each element: pd-text-defclass.

6. To validate the default style, you can check the header.

The **Override Stylesheet** allows users to customize styles for specific elements, enabling precise adjustments to meet unique design requirements. Together, these stylesheets offer a powerful mechanism for managing presentation aesthetics effectively.

The following image shows how the override style options work in Presentation Designer.
