# Overview of a multilingual site Multilingual Solution

A multilingual site consists of content that is localized to support multiple audiences with different languages. Your multilingual site consists of a set of localized and regionalized subsites, including a single base site.

## Types of sites

-   **The base site**

    -   The base site defines the site structure and contains the shared content that is translated.
    -   Some base sites are continually updated, and fresh translations are made.
    -   Other base sites are created once, and used as templates for new sites in other languages.

-   **Translated sites**

    -   In most cases, the entire content and structure of a base site are replicated to a translated site.
    -   In some cases, only a subset of the original base site is reused on the translated site.

-   **Regional sites**

    -   A regional site is similar to a translated site, but involves no translation.
    -   Regional sites reuse content from a base site, but the content is updated for each region. For example, different states in a single country.

-   **Translated Regional Sites**

    -   These types of sites both reuse and update content from a base site, but also translates the updated content.

-   **No base-locale sites**

    -   In this type of site, content is written separately in different sites for different languages, but then synchronized and translated to all the sites and languages.
    
-   **Mixed language sites**

    -   This type of site includes content that is written in multiple languages, but stored in a single site.
    -   Content is grouped by category, not language.
