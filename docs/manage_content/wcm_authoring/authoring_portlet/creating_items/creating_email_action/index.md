# Creating email actions


An email action sends an email to a set of users or groups.

## Email settings

To be able to send a user an email notification during a workflow:

-   Ensure that you configure the `WCM WCMConfigService` service to enable email and specify your SMTP server.
-   Ensure that the user has a valid email address that is defined in their HCL Portal user profile.

To create an email action, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New> Workflow Actions > Email Action**.
