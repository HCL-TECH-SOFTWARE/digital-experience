# Managing References

When you delete items that are referenced by other items, you need to resolve any references that are broken by deleting the item. A dialog opens listing the items that cannot be deleted.

-   Select an item from the list and click **Edit References**.

    -   Select an item and click **Replace Reference** to replace the item you are currently deleting with a different item. For example, if you are deleting a text component that is referenced within a presentation template, you can replace the reference to the text component you are deleting with a different component.
    -   Select an item and click **Clear Reference** to remove the reference to the item you are deleting. For example, if you are deleting a presentation template that is mapped to an authoring template, you can choose to clear the reference to the authoring template.

!!!note
    -   There are occasions where only one option is available. For example, when it is only possible to replace a reference, but not clear a reference, such as when you are deleting a workflow.
    -   Other items might not be able to be deleted at all.
    -   References to authoring templates can be changed only by using the **Apply Template** feature on the item itself.

## Viewing references


You can view and manage all of the links between items by viewing references.

1.  Click the **Application menu** icon. Then, click **Content > Web Content Authoring.**

2.  Select the library that contains the item whose references you want to view.

3.  Select a view type.

4.  View the references.

    -   If you want to open the item, click the item, then click **More > View References**.
    -   If you want to remain in the index, click the check box for the item, then click **More > View References**.
