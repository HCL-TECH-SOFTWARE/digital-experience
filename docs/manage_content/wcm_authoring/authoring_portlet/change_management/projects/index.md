# Projects

Projects are used to change a set of items on your site and ensure that they are published together at the same time. A new project has a default workflow that allows content to be reviewed and approved before it is published.

-   **[Project review state](wcm_dev_projects_reviewing.md)**  
If you select at least one approver for a project, the project must be submitted for review before it can be published.
-   **[Project States](wcm_dev_projects_approving.md)**  
When you use a project, the project progresses through a series of states.
-   **[Ways to publish a project](wcm_dev_projects_publishing.md)**  
Publishing a project refreshes the live website with your changes.
-   **[Project Publishing](wcm_dev_projects_publish.md)**  
An outline of the process of publishing a project.
-   **[Drafts and projects](wcm_mngpages_drafts_projects.md)**  
You can create, update, and approve pages in a draft state, without affecting the published site. When you work with pages, you can edit pages as drafts, manage drafts with approval workflow, and then syndicate to publish changes.
-   **[Scope of edits](wcm_mngpages_editscope.md)**  
When you edit pages in a project, you use workflow for approving changes before you publish them until they are approved. If you edit pages without selecting a project, your changes are published immediately.
-   **[Project Validation](wcm_dev_projects_validate.md)**  
An outline of the validation process.
-   **[Projects and syndication](wcm_dev_projects_syndication.md)**  
Projects are included in syndication, the method that is used by HCL Web Content Manager to replicate data from a web content library on a syndicator server to a web content library on a subscriber server. Although projects are syndicated with other items in a library that is being syndicated, you cannot use the subscriber copy of the project to update or publish your project. Work with projects on the syndicator server only.
-   **[Projects and custom workflow actions](wcm_dev_projects_workflow.md)**  
Each workflow stage contains default actions, but you can also create custom workflow actions by creating a custom workflow plug-in.
-   **[Prohibiting a page from creating outside of a WCM project using page templates](wcm_dev_probihit_page_workflow.md)**
Learn how to prohibit a page from being created outside a WCM project using page templates.

-   **[Best practices for projects](wcm_proj_bestpractice.md)**  
Use these tips and guidelines to develop and publish projects more effectively.
