# Best practices for projects

Use these tips and guidelines to develop and publish projects more effectively.

## Use separate projects for different parts of the site structure

Coordinating projects is an important part of ensuring that changes to your website are published as expected. For example, you might have two authors working on the same part of the site structure but with each author editing pages in a different project. Because the authors are working in different projects, they cannot see draft changes that the other author makes until the projects are published. If both authors insert a new page between the same two published pages, the resulting page order might not be what was intended.

To prevent these situations, avoid editing the same part of the site structure with multiple projects at the same time. Instead, when multiple projects are used at the same time, ensure that you use each project for a different part of the site structure.

## Coordinate changes to a project across users

When multiple users are working in the same project, one user might not be aware of the changes that another user makes. If you change the state of the project, such as deleting it or publishing it, any outstanding updates from other users are not saved. To ensure that you do not inadvertently discard changes from other users, coordinate with users of the project before the state of the project is changed.

## Coordinate unique names across projects

When multiple projects are used for the same site, similar unique names might be introduced in different projects. For example, you might have two authors working on the same site but with each author editing in a different project. Because the authors are working in different projects, they cannot see draft unique names that the other author uses until the projects are published. If both authors insert a similar unique name, the result might not be what was intended.

To prevent these situations, avoid introducing new unique names with multiple projects at the same time. Instead, when using multiple projects at the same time, ensure that you use different unique names within each project.
