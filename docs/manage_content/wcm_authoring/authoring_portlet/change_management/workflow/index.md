# Workflow and change management

You can manage changes to web content items either by creating drafts, by using workflows, or adding items to projects.

-   **[Item status](wcm_managing_workflow_status.md)**  
There are three major status levels that an item can be in at any one time; **Draft**, **Published**, or **Expired**. The current state of an item indicates where the item exists within a change management process, and where that item can be viewed and accessed.
-   **[Workflow stages and actions](../workflow/workflow_stages_actions/index.md)**  
You use workflows to control the access to, verification and eventual approval of items. Only if an item is approved at all stages up to a published stage can it be viewed on your website.
-   **[Adding workflow to managed pages](wcm_mngpages_addworkflow.md)**  
The default workflow that is used for published pages has only a draft and approved state. However, if the default workflow is not sufficient, you can define custom workflows and use them with published pages.
