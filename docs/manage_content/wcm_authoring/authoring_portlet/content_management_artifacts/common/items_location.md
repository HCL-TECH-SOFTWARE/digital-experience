# Specifying a location for an item

This topic explains how to specify single or multiple save locations for an item you created.

## Specifying a single save location

To save an item from its default location to a new location, click **Select Location**.

    !!!note
        -   The default location for a new item is based on the current library and view where you clicked the **New** button.
        -   This field is no longer displayed when the new item is saved for the first time.
        -   When saved, you need to use the "move" function to change the location of an item.

## Specifying multiple save locations

In an authoring template, multiple save locations can be specified:

1. Under the Item Properties dropdown menu, go to Location options: and click **Selected locations**.
2. Click **Add** to open the list of locations the item can be saved in.
3. Click the checkboxes for the additional locations you want the item to be saved under, then click **OK**.
4. In the Choose saving option for the author: option, select **Allow item to be placed under multiple locations**.

    !!!note
        When content items can be saved in multiple locations based on the authoring template, the item is saved in the primary location and links are created in the other save locations specified in the new content item.
