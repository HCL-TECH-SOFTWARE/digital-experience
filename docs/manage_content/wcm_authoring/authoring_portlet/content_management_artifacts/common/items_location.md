# Specifying a location for an item


When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.

1.  Click **Select Location** to save the item under a different location than the default location.

    !!!note
        -   The default location for a new item is based on the current library and view where you clicked the **New** button.
        -   This field is no longer displayed when the new item is saved for the first time.
        -   When saved, you need to use the "move" function to change the location of an item.
