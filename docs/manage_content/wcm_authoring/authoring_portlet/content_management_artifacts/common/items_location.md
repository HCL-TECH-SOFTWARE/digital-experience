# Specifying a location for an item

This topic explains how to specify single or multiple save locations for an item you created.

## Specifying a single save location

To save an item from its default location to a new location, click **Select Location**.

!!!note
    -   The default location for a new item is based on the current library and view where you clicked the **New** button.
    -   This field is no longer displayed when the new item is saved for the first time.
    -   When saved, you need to use the "move" function to change the location of an item.

## Specifying multiple save locations

In an authoring template, you can specify multiple save locations for an item.

1. Under **Item Properties**, go to **Location options** and click **Selected locations**.
2. Click **Add** to open the list of locations the item can be saved in.
3. Select the checkbox for the additional location you want the item to be saved under, then click **OK**.
4. In **Choose saving option for the author**, select **Allow item to be placed under multiple locations**.
    For content items that can be saved in multiple locations based on the authoring template, the item is saved in the primary location and links are created in the other save locations specified in the new content item.
5. Click **Save and Close** at the bottom of the page to save your changes.

## Specifying multiple save locations inside of a new content item

When a new content item is created using authoring templates with multiple save locations, you can also save the item in multiple locations.

1. After creating the new content item, click **Add Locations**. A pop-up window appears where you can select a Site Area.
2. Select a location you want to save the item in, then click **OK**. Repeat this step for every location you want to include.
3. (Optional) If you want to add or remove multiple locations, click **Manage multiple selections**.

    !!!note
        If the **Add Locations** section is populated, you need to clear it before clicking **Manage multiple selections**.
