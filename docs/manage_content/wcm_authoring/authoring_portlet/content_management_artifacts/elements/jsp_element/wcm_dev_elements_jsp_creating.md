# Creating a JSP component


You create a JSP component when you want to reuse a section of JSP in multiple places in your website.

To create a JSP component, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Component > JSP**.

1.  [Entering identification information](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_id.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Specifying a location for an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_location.md)  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Selecting a JSP file](./wcm_dev_elements_jsp_props.md)  
You use the JSP element to select a JSP file to store in the component.
4.  [Entering item properties](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_props.md)  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
5.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/grant_access.md)  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
