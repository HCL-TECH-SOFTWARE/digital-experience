# Creating a content template



Create a content template to configure the design of the authoring form and determine what elements can be included in the form.

To create a content template, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Authoring Template > Content Template**.

-   **[Entering identification information](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_id.md)**  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
-   **[Specifying a location for an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_location.md)**  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
-   **[Defining content item properties](wcm_dev_auth-temp_contentprop.md)**  
Specify the characteristics of the item that is generated from the content template, including the type of item to be created, where it can be saved and version control strategies.
-   **[Defining form properties](../creating_sitearea_template/wcm_dev_auth-temp_formprop.md)**  
Specify the layout and functions available to authors when you create a new item that is based on this content template.
-   **[Entering item properties](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_props.md)**  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
-   **[Granting users or groups access to an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/grant_access.md)**  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
-   **[Adding elements to an item](../../elements/wcm_dev_elements_adding.md)**  
You add elements to site areas, content items, page items, and authoring templates to store web content specific to those items.
-   **[Entering content item properties](wcm_dev_items_props_atc_cont.md)**  
Specify properties for the current item, including an alternative presentation template and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item.
-   **[Entering profile information](../creating_sitearea_template/wcm_dev_profiling_items.md)**  
Specify the profile information that is used to identify the current item, such as the categories to which the item belongs and any keywords that you want to associate with the item.
-   **[Selecting a workflow](../creating_sitearea_template/wcm_dev_workflow_items.md)**  
The workflow section is only visible on item types that are enabled to use a workflow. Only content items, and site areas not based on the default site area template, are enabled by default.
