# Overriding presentation templates

To modify the presentation template of a Content Template Catalog content type, you can override a copy of the presentation template through a mapping in your top-level site area, or for a specific site area. The top-level site is usually the best place to make this override.

Copy Content Template presentation templates into your design library and modify them. Use them in template mappings in your sites or map them directly to your own authoring templates. Do not modify the original presentation templates because they are overwritten when you install Content Template updates.
