You can customize the visual appearance of the markup that your social rendering view definitions generate. The markup generation is controlled by the appearance component that your individual list view definition content items reference.

You create the visual designs for your social rendering view definitions by using social rendering appearance components. Social rendering appearance components are implemented as  HCL Web Content Manager Personalization components. Personalization components that you use with social rendering must wrap a Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal selection rule.
