You add elements to site areas, content items, page items, and authoring templates to store web content specific to those items.

To add, remove or edit elements, click **Manage Elements** from the toolbar of a site area, content item, page item, or authoring template form.

-   To add an element:

    1.  Select an element type.

    2.  Enter a name. Do not use double-byte and non-ASCII characters.

    3.  Enter a display title to use as the title of the element displayed indexes and forms.

    4.  If you create a text provider plug-in for a multi-locale site, you can also select the text provider and enter a key to look up a string from the selected text provider. The text provider displays a different display title for each language it is configured for. The text that is entered in the **Display Title** field is only used if an appropriate display title is not available from the selected text provider, or if the text provider is not available.

    5.  Click **Add**.

-   To remove an element, click ![delete](../images/delete.jpg).

-   To copy an element, click ![copy](../images/copy.jpg).

    1.  Enter a name. Do not use double-byte and non-ASCII characters.

    2.  Enter a display title to use as the title of the element displayed indexes and forms.

    3.  Click **Add**.

-   To edit an element, click ![edit](../images/edit.jpg). Changing an element type might result in lost data from an existing element. Click **Update** to save any changes.

-   Use the arrows to change the order that the elements appear in an item form.


**Note:** Do not overuse elements in a single item. The more elements that you add to an item, the longer it takes to open in the authoring portlet.
