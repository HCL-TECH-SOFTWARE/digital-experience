From time to time, you need to move, copy, or link items.

-   **[Copying a site area](wcm_dev_sites_copying.md)**  
As your site framework evolves, you are required to edit your site framework by copying site areas from one section of your site framework to another. You use the **copy** feature to copy a site area in the site framework.
-   **[Moving a site area](wcm_dev_sites_moving.md)**  
As your site framework evolves, you are required to edit your site framework by moving site areas from one section of your site framework to another. You use the **Move** feature to change the position of a site area in the site framework. When you reposition a parent site area, any child site areas and related content are also moved.
-   **[How to link or copy content items to site areas](wcm_dev_content_linking_linking.md)**  
When a content item is first created, you must select a site area to save the content item under. You can link content items to other site area with the **Link** and **Add Links** buttons. You can also copy a content item to a different site area with the **Copy** button.
-   **[Moving a content item](wcm_dev_content_linking_moving.md)**  
You move content items from one site area to another using the **Move To** feature. This is different from linking content as the content you choose to move is removed from the original site area.
-   **[How to remove content item links from site areas](wcm_dev_content_linking_removing.md)**  
You remove content items from site areas with the **Remove Links** or **Link** featured. This procedure is different from deleting content items because the content you choose to remove is removed from a site area, but not from the web content library.
-   **[Copying other items to a different library](wcm_dev_items_copying.md)**  
You use the **Copy** feature to copy an item from one library to another.
-   **[Moving other items between libraries](wcm_dev_items_moving.md)**  
You use the **Move** feature to move an item between libraries.
