As a taxonomy evolves, you are required to edit your taxonomy by moving categories from one section of your taxonomy to another. You use the **Move** feature to change the position of a category in a taxonomy. When you reposition a parent category, any child categories are also moved.

1.  Browse to a category list.

2.  Select a category.

3.  Click **Move**.

4.  Select a library.

5.  Select a taxonomy or a category to move the category under. Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children you can still browse down to select them.

6.  Click **OK**.
