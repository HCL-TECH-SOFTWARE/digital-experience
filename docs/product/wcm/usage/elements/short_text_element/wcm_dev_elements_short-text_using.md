A short text element is used to store small amounts of fixed-length text where the length is 250 bytes or less. Unlike the other text elements, short text elements can also be used as a search parameter in a Personalization rule. To create a short text element, you can either add a short text element to an authoring template, site area, or content item, or create a short text component.

-   **[Creating a short text component](wcm_dev_elements_short-text_creating.md)**  
You create a short text component when you want to reuse a small section of text in multiple places in your website. For example, you can use a short text component to store the name of a product or service.
-   **[Adding a short text element to an item](wcm_dev_elements_short-text_adding.md)**  
You add a short text element to a site area or content item when you want a small section of text to be used for a specific site area or content item.
-   **[Adding a short text element to a template](wcm_dev_elements_short-text_add_template.md)**  
You add a short text element to an authoring template when you want a short text element to be used by a set of items that use the same authoring template.
