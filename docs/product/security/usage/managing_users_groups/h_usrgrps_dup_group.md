You can use this feature to assign one member to the same groups as an existing member.

Suppose you have just created a new user, Mary. You need to assign Mary to the same groups to which Hans, an existing portal user, already belongs. Instead of manually adding Mary to all of the groups in which Hans is a member, use the duplicate group assignments feature.

In order to duplicate group assignments, you must have sufficient permissions. If you do not have sufficient permission to make any one of the group assignments, then none of the assignments are made.

In order to duplicate group assignments, you must have either of the following:

-   At least the Editor role on all groups of which Hans is a member, and the Security\_Administrator@Users role. Users is a virtual resource.
-   The Administrator@Portal role. This allows you to assign any user or group to any role on any resource.

Perform these steps to duplicate group assignments:

1.  Choose one of the following methods to find the user or group that will inherit the role assignment:

    -   Search for the user or group.
    -   Click the **All Portal User Groups** link for a list of all groups.
    -   Click the **All Authenticated Portal Users** for a list of all users.
2.  Click the **Duplicate group assignments** icon for the user or user group that will inherit the group assignments.

3.  Click the **Select** radio button for the user or group that will serve as the model for the role assignment.

4.  Click **OK** to save your changes, or **Cancel** to exit without saving your changes.
