To render the Forms Experience Builder on a portal page, an Administrator must deploy the Forms Experience Builder portlet on that page. If the Forms Experience Builder portlet is not installed with Forms Experience Builder, you can manually install it.

Verify whether the portlet is installed. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portlet Management** \> **Portlets**. Type Forms in the **Search** field and then click **OK**. If the portlet is found, you do not need to install the portlet.

1.  Log in to HCL Digital Experience as the Administrator.

2.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portlet Management** \> **Web Modules**.

3.  Click **Install**.

4.  Click **Browse**.

5.  Find the FormsExperiencePortlet.war file and then, click **Open**.

    **Tip:** The FormsExperiencePortlet.war file is found in the Forms Experience Builder server installation folder.

6.  Click **Next** and then, complete the installation steps.
