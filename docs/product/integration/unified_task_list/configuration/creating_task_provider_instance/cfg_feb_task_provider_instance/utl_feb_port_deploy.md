To use the Forms Experience Builder portlet, you must deploy and configure the portlet on a portal page.

1.  Either create a portal page or open an existing portal page.

2.  Deploy the Forms Experience Builder portlet on the page.

3.  Create wires between the page with the Unified Task List portlet and the page with the Forms Experience Builder portlet.

    For more information about creating wires, go to *Adding a wire*.

4.  Configure the Forms Experience Builder portlet by specifying the following values:

    1.  **Forms Experience Builder URL**.

        For example, http://forms.server.instance.domain.ext:port/forms.

    2.  **Portal Proxy URL**.

        For example, http://portal.server.com:port/wps/proxy.

    3.  After you specify the URLs for the Forms Experience Builder and Portal Proxy, click **OK**.

5.  Click **Apply** and **OK** to save the configuration
