Wires allow portlets to interact with each other. For example, portlets can exchange information, or an action in one portlet can update another portlet.

A wire allows two or more portlets to transfer information so that an action, publishing event, or click in a source portlet automatically triggers an action or event and updates the display in the target portlet. As a result, multiple portlets can be updated simultaneously when information is changed. You can create wires only between cooperative portlets and portlets that define events, that is portlets that have been developed to share information with other portlets. When you first open the Wires portlet, all public wires and your personal wires for the page are displayed.

Use the Wires portlet to perform the tasks described in the following topics. When you have completed working with the wires, click **Done** to save your changes. You are returned to the page from which you first accessed Wires.

**Notes:**

1.  While you make changes to the wires on its page, the page is deactivated.
2.  While you edit the page, all changes are effective immediately. You cannot undo or cancel your updates.
3.  Other users will not be able to access the page until you commit the changes by clicking **Done**.
4.  For a complete description of portal terms such as portlet, refer to the portal page help.
