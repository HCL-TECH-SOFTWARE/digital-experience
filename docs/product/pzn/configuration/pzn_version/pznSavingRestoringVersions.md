You can save an object with a new version number. Later you can restore that version if needed.

1.  Select the object that you want to create a version of.

2.  Click **More actions** \> **Versions** \> **Create Version**.

3.  The name that you provide for the version is used to restore the version. Use descriptive names.


You might need to restore a previous version of an object in order to make it the current version. For example, if incorrect information is placed in recent versions, it might be easier to replace the current version of the object with a previous version. If you restore a previous object version, all changes that are made since the latest version was created are lost.

Select the object to restore and click **More Actions** \> **Versions** \> **Restore Version**.
