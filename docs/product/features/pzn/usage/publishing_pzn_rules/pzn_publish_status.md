# Monitoring the status of publishing

After you start a job to publish a personalization rule, you can monitor the status to make sure the publish completes successfully.

All publish jobs that are currently running or have been completed are displayed in the status view. If an error occurs, to get more information, turn on the Java Run time Environment tracing for WebSphere on the client system or examine the error and trace logs on the server system.

1.  To see the status of all current publish jobs, select **More Actions** \> **Publish** \> **View Status**.

2.  After a job has completed \(successfully or otherwise\) a close icon displays that you can click to remove the job from the list of monitored jobs.

    If you click this icon, you can no longer view the status of that job.
