# Image element

You store an image in an image element.

When you store an image in an image element:

-   You can reference the image anywhere in your site regardless of the original file location or URL.
-   The image is automatically transferred to other servers during syndication.
-   You can reference the image element within other items as required.

## Creating an image element

To create an image element, you can either add an image element to an authoring template, site area or content item, or create an image component.

**Note:** Images with names that include non-ascii characters cannot be pre-rendered. If you are pre-rendering a site, you must rename the image before you add it to the image element.

## Valid mime types

You can configure which mime types are valid for an image element by editing the `imageresourcecmpnt.allowedmimetypes` setting. See [Web content authoring options](wcm_config_prop_authoring.md) for further information.
