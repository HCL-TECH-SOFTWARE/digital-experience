# Component reference element

You use a component reference element to store a reference to a component.

You can use component reference elements in two ways:

-   A component-reference element can be added to an authoring template so that content creators can select an existing component from the component library rather than build the component themselves.
-   By referencing a component-reference element in a presentation template or another element, the component that is being displayed can be changed without having to change the presentation template or element design.

    For example, if you referenced a component-reference element called "Featured Product" in more than one presentation template the element that is referenced within the component-reference element can be changed without having to edit the presentation templates.


## Creating a component reference element

To create a component reference element, you can either add a component reference element to an authoring template, site area or content item, or create a component reference component.
