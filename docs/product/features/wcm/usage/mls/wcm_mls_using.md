# How to use the HCL Web Content Manager Multilingual Solution

The multilingual solution is used to author, manage, and publish multilingual content.

-   **[Framework for multilingual site management Multilingual Solution](../wcm/wcm_mls_framework.md)**  
The framework covers a data model for storing multilingual sites, processes for managing multilingual sites, and a model for delivering multilingual sites to site visitors.
-   **[Multilingual authoring Multilingual Solution](../wcm/wcm_mls_authoring.md)**  
Nearly all authoring tasks occur in the base site, and are then replicated, if appropriate, to all of the localized sites. Authoring occurs on translated sites for language or region-specific content, or to fix errors in translation.
-   **[Lifecycle and synchronization Multilingual Solution](../wcm/wcm_mls_lifecycle.md)**  
Workflow is used to keep the base site and localized sites synchronized. The creation, modification, publishing, expiry, deletion, and moving of site areas and content can be synchronized across locales by using a workflow.
-   **[Localized rendering](../wcm/wcm_mls_rendering.md)**  
Localized rendering is provided by either automatically matching the user locale with the content locale, or by providing a navigation option in the site to allow the user to choose the locale for themselves. These two strategies might also be used together in some cases.
-   **[Creating more multilingual sites Multilingual Solution](../wcm/wcm_mls_adding.md)**  
In many cases, the number of languages or regions you require for a site is fixed, but there are times when you need to roll out new locales as your organization grows.
-   **[Advanced options Multilingual Solution](../wcm/wcm_mls_advanced.md)**  
There are more points of extensibility where you can enhance the multilingual solution to suit your specific requirements.
