# Planning to use Content Template

You must install Content Template Catalog on all servers you plan to use to develop, demonstrate, manage, or deliver a site that uses Content Template page templates and portlets.

If you attempt to use a site that is created from Content Template templates on a server that does not have Content Template installed, you cannot instantiate the templates or portlets that are based on Content Template. The rendering of many components throughout the templates fails due to missing plug-ins.
