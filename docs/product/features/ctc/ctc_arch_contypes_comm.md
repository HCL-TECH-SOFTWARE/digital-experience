# Communication content template

The Communication content template is used for internal communications, such as executive communications and postings from a particular organizational unit. You can add a shared communications area that is used by a number of executives or units, or more typically, you can create a communications area for each.

The communication template has an extra image field for placing an image in the header of the content. Such an image might be an author’s photograph, giving the presentation an "editorial"? feel, or it might be a topical image. The communication template includes Contact fields to allow contact information to be added for the author or for someone else.
