# Overview for CTC site authors

It is recommended that Site Builder is used to start creating a CTC site. Site Builder automates the first few steps of creating a new site. Site Builder creates a site area, a content library, and a home page automatically. Depending on the site template design, the Site Builder also creates extra pages and links them to the home page. Developing a site without Site Builder means creating a home page and landing pages manually, setting up page component configurations, then adding special content such as teasers and integrating social media.

**Tip:** Site Builder eliminates the first few steps of creating a site from scratch. Instead, you use a wizard to create a site area, a content library, and a home page automatically. Depending on the site template design, the wizard also creates extra pages and links them to the home page. You can make some page modifications in Site Builder. For other modifications, you return to HCL Web Content Manager to finish setting up the site.
