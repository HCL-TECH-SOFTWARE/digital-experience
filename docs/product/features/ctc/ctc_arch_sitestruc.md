# Site structure and page templates

Each site that you build with Content Template Catalog contains several page templates and a repeated structure for each site area in the content repository. You must follow this pattern when you build a Content Template site because that is how the templates were designed. Each template instantiates a "microsite" of content artifacts along with the page. The portlets on the page are automatically linked to this content.

Content Template has page templates that can be used to create landing pages, index pages, and details pages. Landing pages create the overall site structure and create a hierarchical navigation structure when they are nested. A combination of index and details pairings, stand-alone details pages, and combined index and details pages provide content areas for your site.

When a Content Template Catalog page template is instantiated, a partial site, called a microsite, is copied into your site at the same time.
