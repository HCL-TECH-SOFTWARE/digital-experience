# Working with list-rendering profiles

You can create new or derived list-rendering profiles. After you create a list-rendering profile, you deploy it.

-   **[Structure of list-rendering profiles](../social/plrf_lr_profl_strctr.md)**  
A list-rendering profile consists of a set of name-value pairs.
-   **[Creating list-rendering profiles](../social/plrf_crt_lr_profiles.md)**  
When you create a list-rendering profile, you can either create a completely new profile or create a derived profile by extending an existing profile. A derived profile includes the item attribute and list property declarations of other list-rendering profiles by referencing these profiles.
-   **[Deploying list-rendering profiles](../social/plrf_dply_lr_profiles.md)**  
You can choose between two ways of deploying your custom list-rendering profiles.
