# Global lists - Themes and Skins

For ease of use, two global lists hold the common name of all themes and skins. You can access the global lists with the listall command, which expects the list name as an argument. The following list names are supported. See the bean help for alternative list names.

-   themes
-   skins

Jython example:

```
# example: list the names of all themes
Look.listall("themes")

# example output:
Admin WebSphere Engineering Science Finance Corporate
```

Jacl example:

```
# example: list the names of all themes
$Look listall themes

# example output:
