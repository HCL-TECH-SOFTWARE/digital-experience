Use navigators and menus to create links to content, and display content-level navigation.

-   **Navigators**

    Navigators display links to different site areas in a website. They represent the logical arrangement of the content displayed within each page of your site.

    A set of element designs is used to format the look of each branch of a navigator.

-   **Menus**

    A menu displays metadata and content from content items that match the search criteria of the menu element. The search criteria of a menu can include matching site areas, authoring templates, categories, and keywords.
