Web content libraries are used to store your web content and managed pages. Syndication is used to keep libraries in synch between your different server environments.

When setting up a website, you should only create multiple libraries when:

-   You need to manage the access and security of different types of content for different users and groups in different ways. For example, by creating different libraries for design elements and content elements, different groups could be assigned library level access in different ways on each library,
-   You need to manage syndication strategies differently for different types of content. For example, by creating different libraries for design elements and content elements, different syndication strategies are applied to each library. The content library could be assigned automatic syndication, whereas the design library could be manually syndicated only when it was appropriate to do so.

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Content** \> **Web Content Libraries**.
