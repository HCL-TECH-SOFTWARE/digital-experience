|Term|Description|
|----------|--------------------------------|
|Bitness|Compatibility of the product with the bit version support that is provided by an operating system. Different parts of a product might run on the same operating system but support different application bitness. For example, one part of the product might run only in 32-bit mode, whereas another might support 64-bit tolerate mode.<br/>31: The product or part of the product runs as a 31-bit application in a 31-bit operating environment.<br/>32: The product or part of the product runs as a 32-bit application in a 32-bit operating environment.<br/>64-tolerate: The product or part of the product runs as a 32-bit application in a 64-bit operating environment.<br/>64-exploit: The product or part of the product runs natively as a 64-bit application in a 64-bit operating environment.|
|Co-packaged|Additional products that are included in the product package|
|Co-installed|Additional products that are included in the product package and installed when the product is installed.|
|Deployment unit|Deployment Structure identifies pieces of a product that can be independently deployed onto one or more machines in a distributed infrastructure:<br/>- The top level of the deployment structure consists of one or more deployment units. There are four possible deployment units that a product might support: Desktop, Server, Agent or client, Mobile.<br/>- Deployment units may be further divided into deployable components<br/>Desktop deployment unit: Part of the deployment structure intended for use by a single user, typically installed on the user desktops. Examples of desktop deployment units include development tools, administrative tools, stand-alone business applications.<br/>Server deployment unit: Part of the deployment structure that can provide services to multiple clients, providing the server in a client-server architecture. Examples of server deployment units include application servers, management servers, database servers and server-based business applications.<br/>Agent or client deployment unit: Part of the deployment structure that allows remote connection between software. Examples of agent of client deployment units include agents in management system that are installed in the same tier as the managed resources, a remote application, or database clients that are installed with the software accessing the remote services.<br/>Mobile deployment unit: Part of the deployment structure intended for use by a single user, typically installed on a mobile device. An example of a mobile deployment unit is a mobile application.|
|Hypervisor|A virtual machine in which a product can run on a guest operating system.|
|Limited operating system support|By default, the supported guest operating systems for a product and a hypervisor are the operating systems that are supported by both the product and the hypervisor. If a product restricts support to a subset of these operating systems, this restriction will be indicated by specifying that there is Limited Operating System Support.|
|Operating system minimum|The minimum operating system maintenance level that is required to run on the product.|
|Prerequisite minimum|The minimum maintenance level that is required for the prerequisite to work with the product.|
|Product minimum|The minimum maintenance level that is required for the product to run on the operating system, on an hypervisor, or work with a prerequisite product or supported software.|
|Supported software minimum|The minimum maintenance level that is required for the supported software to work with the product.|
|Long Term Support Release|A Long Term Support Release is a recommended product level for which support, including defect and security updates, will be provided over a specified period of time.|
|Continuous Delivery Product|A Continuous Delivery Product delivers new function to clients more frequently.|
|Continuous Delivery Product - Long Term Support Release|A Continuous Delivery Product delivers new function to clients more frequently. Since frequent releases may not be suitable for all client environments, Long Term Support Releases provide a package that will be supported for a longer period of time.|
