# Unsupported

An “Unsupported Configuration” is a combination of HCL Software and other Dependent Products (usually at a specified version, release, fix or specification level) that is known to not work with HCL Digital Experience and is therefore not supported.

HCL does not provide support for Unsupported Configurations. Resolutions to deficiencies or incompatibilities found in Unsupported Configurations are not generally available.

For more details, make sure to review this document: [HCL DX support statement](/digital-experience/get_started/software_support/).
