# Supported configurations

A “supported configuration” is a combination of HCL Software and other dependent products (typically at a specified version, release, fix, or specification level) that has been validated by HCL.

HCL provides full support for configurations in this category. Support is provided under the terms of the product license to ensure that the product operates within its specifications.  

For more details, see [HCL DX support statement](../../../get_started/software_support.md).

## Operating systems

HCL Digital Experience V9.5 supports the following operating systems, which are organized by operating system family. Operating system families include AIX, Linux, and Windows.

### AIX family

|Operating system (OS)|Supported versions|Hardware|Bit version|Product minimum|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|AIX 7.1|Base and later maintenance releases|POWER System - Big Endian|64-Exploit, 64-Tolerate|8.5|
|AIX 7.2|Base and later maintenance releases|Power System - Big Endian|64-Exploit, 64-Tolerate|9.0|
|AIX 7.3|Base and later maintenance releases|Power System - Big Endian|64-Exploit, 64-Tolerate|9.5|

!!! important 
	If the installation of DX on AIX 7.3 fails (with missing library messages) while you use the IBM Installation Manager (IIM) installer contained in the DX Setup ``.zip`` files, then use the a later version of IBM AIX IIM (version 1.9.2.3 or later). Using a later IIM version helps ensure that the required AIX 7.3 libraries for installation are present. Refer to the following link to check the list of IIM fix levels and their corresponding download links: [Fix list for Installation Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/fix-list-installation-manager).

!!! important 
	The Portal Express offering does not support AIX.
