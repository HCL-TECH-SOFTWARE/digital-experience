# Supported Configuration

A “Supported Configuration” is a combination of HCL Software and other Dependent Products (usually at a specified version, release, fix or specification level) that has been validated by HCL.

HCL provides full support for configurations within this category. Support is provided under the terms of the product license, to ensure that the product operates within its specifications.  

For more details, make sure to review this document: [HCL DX support statement](../../../get_started/software_support.md).

## Operating Systems

The operating systems section specifies the operating systems that HCL Digital Experience 9.5 supports, and is organized by the operating system family. Operating system families include AIX, Linux, and Windows.

### AIX family

|Operating system (OS)|OS Supported Versions|Hardware|Bitness|Product minimum|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|AIX 7.1|Base and later maintenance releases|POWER System - Big Endian|64-Exploit, 64-Tolerate|8.5|
|AIX 7.2|Base and later maintenance releases|Power System - Big Endian|64-Exploit, 64-Tolerate|9.0|
|AIX 7.3|Base and later maintenance releases|Power System - Big Endian|64-Exploit, 64-Tolerate|9.5|

!!! important "Installing DX on AIX 7.3"
    If the AIX IIM installation fails using the IIM installer contained in the DX Setup zips (with missing library messages) then use the IBM AIX IIM later level (1.9.2.3 or later version) to ensure that the needed AIX 7.3 required libraries for install is present. Refer to the link below to check the list of IIM fix level and their corresponding download link: [Fix list for Installation Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/fix-list-installation-manager)
