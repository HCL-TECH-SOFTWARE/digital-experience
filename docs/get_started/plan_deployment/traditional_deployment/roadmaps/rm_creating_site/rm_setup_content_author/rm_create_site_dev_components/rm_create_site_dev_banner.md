# Creating the banner page component

This roadmap highlights how to create the banner page component of the design from an HTML component. The banner page component is used on the Home, Product, and Events page.

## Who should use this roadmap

You are a developer on the technical team that is tasked with creating home and landing page templates for content authors to use on the site. You are responsible only for creating page components and design templates. Other developers are responsible for developing other pieces of the design. Learn the basics of developing the banner. You might refer to the banner as a hero image that spans full width across the one-column layout.
