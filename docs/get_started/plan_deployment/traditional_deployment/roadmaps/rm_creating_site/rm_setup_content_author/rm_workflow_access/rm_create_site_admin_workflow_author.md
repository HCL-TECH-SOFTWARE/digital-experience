# Author access per workflow stage

Set up access for content authors that want to create landing pages from a new page template. The page template is based on a wire frame design.


# Background information for the administrator: Identify the goals of the content authors

You perform a task analysis of content authors for each stage of a workflow that you recently created.

You will later need set up access control for content authors in other authoring roles. For example, a user that does not create draft content or manage their project would not need the same access rights. Users that can review or publish content require different access rights. You plan to refer to other roadmaps for these authoring roles to understand their goals and required access per workflow stage once you complete setting up access for the a content author group.

![Image of a flowchart that shows and describes roles for the Draft stage, Review stage, and Publish stage. Administrators need to assign Manager access to the draft stage so content authors can create a project, create content, and edit their content. Administrators need to assign Reviewer access to this stage so content authors can move draft content to the review stage. Administrators need to assign User access to content authors to check the status of their content, since the content author is waiting to find out if their drafts will move to the publish stage or be returned to the draft stage. During the Publish stage, Administrators need to assign Draft Creator access to content authors so they can create drafts of published content.](../_img/rm-workflow-author.jpeg)
