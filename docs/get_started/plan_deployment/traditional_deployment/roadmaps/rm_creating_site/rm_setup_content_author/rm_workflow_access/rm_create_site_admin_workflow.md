# Controlling content flow with workflows

Learn how to set up access across various content author roles who can create drafts, route drafts for review, check content status, and publish content.

# Who should use this roadmap

You already created groups to represent your content author and reviewer roles and added users to these groups. Now, you must set access control for these groups to ensure that the content authors and reviewers have the correct access level at each phase of the authoring process. Use this roadmap to learn more about your options and to see a step-by-step example of setting access control for these groups to control what is published on the site.

# Access control: Use workflows to control what content is published on the site

From the Web Content Library, you plan to create a workflow that contains Draft, Review, and Publish stages.

1.  The Draft and Publish stages are available to use in your workflow as samples. Your goal is to create a three stage workflow that includes a Review Stage. You plan to use the sample Draft and Publish stages and create the Review stage. After you create the Review stage, you can create your workflow
