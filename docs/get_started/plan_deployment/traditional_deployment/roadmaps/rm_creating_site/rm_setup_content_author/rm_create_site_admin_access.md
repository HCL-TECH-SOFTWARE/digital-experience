# Authors, groups, setting permissions

Administrators must understand the roles and goals of content authors to grant the appropriate permissions. Learn how to create users, create content author and reviewer groups, and grant access to resources and libraries.


## Background information for the administrator: Identify the goals of the content authors

As the administrator, you must understand the various content author roles. For example, a content author might want to create a landing page from a page template. For this type of site update, the content author creates a project and then creates a page from a page template in site manager. To accomplish these goals, the content author needs to exist in the system and belong to a content author group. The content author would need access to projects to create or enter a project and access to other resources types like pages in order to create a draft page.

A content reviewer role also exists in the content authoring story. You need to add the content reviewer to the system to a content reviewer group. The content reviewer group needs sufficient access to view draft content and to move drafts to the next workflow stage.

The flow chart highlights the content authors and reviewers goals and the tasks that administrators must complete for these roles to accomplish their goals.

This roadmap focuses on creating users and groups, assigning resource permissions, and assigning library permissions.

To learn more about how an administrator defines workflow access control, go to the Roadmaps section and find *Roadmap: Controlling who can create drafts, reviews, and publish content with workflows*.

<!--- Flow chart that displays task flow of content author that wants to create and publish a page. The image highlights the Administrator's current goal and next steps as it relates to the content author. In order for the content author to log in to the site, the administrator must create groups for content authors and reviewers and adds users to groups. In order for the content author to create a draft landing page with the new landing page template, the content author needs access to edit the page. The administrator must grant the content author and content reviewer groups access to pages, virtual resources, and libraries. The administrator's next steps is to create a 3 stage workflow and assign access per stage to content author and review groups. This workflow is associated with the new page template. The content author can then send content out for review for the content reviewer to approve. After the content reviewer approves the draft content, the content moves to the publish stage of the workflow. --->

# Assigning the authoring groups access to pages and vanity URLs

The content authoring options that are available to content authors depend on the resource permissions that you assign.

2.  Assign access to resources types that content authors and content reviewers use to create and publish content.
3.  Assign access to pages. Assign the Content Authors Group to the Contributor role. Assign the Content Reviewers Group to the User role.

    If the access control is set up correctly, **Create Sibling Page** and the **Create Child Page** options are available and enabled in the context menu from Site Manager for the content author. Content authors must have access to these options to create a new landing page from a page template. For content authors to create drafts from published content, the administrator must assign the appropriate workflow access. Instructions for workflow permissions are contained in a later roadmap.

    1.  Click **Pages**.

    2.  Click the **Assign Access** icon by the Content Root. A list of roles that are associated with the Page resource appears.
