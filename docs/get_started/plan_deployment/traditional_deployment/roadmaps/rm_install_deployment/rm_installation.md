# Roadmaps for installation and deployment

Installation and deployment roadmaps each include a topology and high-level instructions for setting up a selected development or authoring environment.

-   **[HCL Digital Experience roadmaps for stand-alone servers](../rm_install_deployment/rm_standalone_servers/rm_standalone_parent.md)**  
A stand-alone server topology is useful for many environments. While the underlying topology is similar for many environments, the configuration steps to achieve a desired environment varies.
-   **[HCL Digital Experience roadmap for container-based deployment](../../../container_deployment/rm_container/index.md)**  
A container-based deployment offers the capability to place them on different physical or virtual machines, on premises or in the cloud.
-   **[Roadmaps for clusters](../rm_install_deployment/rm_clusters/rm_cluster_parent.md)**  
Clusters topologies provide greater availability and capacity.
-   **[HCL Digital Experience roadmaps for advanced configurations](../rm_install_deployment/rm_advanced_cfg/rm_adv_parent.md)**  
Multiple clusters and portal farms are advanced configurations.
-   **[HCL Digital Experience roadmap: Web content servers](rm_web_content_dev.md)**  
In this roadmap, the web server, database, and user registry software are distributed to different physical servers.
