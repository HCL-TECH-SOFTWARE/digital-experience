# HCL Digital Experience roadmap: Multiple clusters

Add an HCL Portal cluster to an existing cluster.

Read [Planning for multiple clusters](../../../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/cluster_consideration/multiple_cluster/index.md) before you start to create your multiple clusters.

!!!remember
    Ensure that you configure the web server plug-in after you transfer your database.


## Who should use this roadmap

Use this roadmap if you are an organization with the following requirements:

-   An organization that has an existing cluster and needs to add more clusters to the existing one.
-   An organization that wants to manage many application servers and clusters within a single administrative domain or cell.
-   An organization that wants to manage multiple portals and portal-based products within the same managed cell.

## Topology diagram

The multiple cluster topology depicts two portal clusters that share a cell. One deployment manager manages the cell. Each cluster has an individual database for the JCR and Release portal database domains. The clusters share a common database server that has the Community, Customization, LikeMinds, and Feedback portal database domains. The clusters also share an LDAP server and a remote search server. There is a search collection for each cluster, but the collections are co-located on a single server.

!!!note
    The release and JCR databases are separate. Therefore, apply maintenance and application updates, including updates to portlet preferences, separately to each cluster.

A network load balance directs incoming traffic between the two web servers. Each cluster has a web server. However, a single on-demand router might be used instead.

## Preparing for the installation process

Gather information and software before you install HCL Digital Experience.

1.  Check product system requirements.

2.  Log in to [HCL Software Support](https://www.hcltechsw.com/wps/portal/about/welcome.html) and get the software.


## Installing prerequisites

You can use existing prerequisite software installations. Verify that your existing version is supported. If it is not, upgrade to the appropriate version. Otherwise, install a web server, database server, and user registry server. Typically the database and user registry servers are already installed and configured. However, there might be specific configuration steps that are required to integrate them with the portal server. Visit *Installing and preparing the prerequisite software* for more topic information.

1.  Install a web server.

2.  Prepare a database server.

3.  Prepare a user registry.


## Installing the HCL Digital Experience

Installing HCL Digital Experience involves preparing your operating system, installing or upgrading the installation manager, and running the installation program. Visit *Installing the HCL Digital Experience software* for more topic information.

## Applying the latest cumulative fix

Portal maintenance is delivered through individual fixes (Fixes) and Combined Cumulative Fixes (CFs), which is recommended to your environment.

Documentation resource: [Roadmap: applying maintenance](../../../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/roadmaps/rm_install_deployment/rm_cf.md)

## Creating cluster A

Create your first cluster, including the database transfer, augmenting the Deployment Manager, creating a cluster node, enabling security, and creating additional horizontal cluster nodes. These instructions are for a horizontal cluster only. For information on setting up a vertical cluster, see [Setting up a cluster](../../../../../../deployment/manage/config_cluster/index.md).

Log in to HCL Digital Experience to verify that you have a working portal:

```
http://hostname.example.com:10039/wps/portal,
where hostname.example.com is the fully qualified host name of the server where
Portal is running and 10039 is the default transport port that is created by DX® Application Server. The port number might be different
for your environment.
```

1.  To get the latest updates for the wizard, apply the most recent Combined Cumulative Fix. For more information about applying the latest fix pack, visit [Apply Combined Cumulative Fix](../../../../../../deployment/install/traditional/cf_install/index.md) for more topic information.

    !!!note
        Skip this step, if you have the most recent fix pack applied.

2.  Access the Configuration Wizard. Go to http://your_server:10200/hcl/wizard.

    !!!note
        If working with HCL Digital Experience 8.5 or 9 software level prior to CF18, the wizard address will be: http://your_server:10200/ibm/wizard. After installing CF18, the configuration wizard will automatically be adjusted to http://your_server:10200/hcl/wizard.

    !!!restriction
        There is a known issue with Chrome version 45.x and the Configuration Wizard. If you are experiencing difficulties, use a different browser when you access the wizard.

3.  Log in to the Configuration Wizard with the administrative ID for the configuration wizard profile, cw\_profile.

    !!!note
        If the language is not currently supported for the user interface, you might see the English version. For details on supported languages and the language codes for all of the HCL Portal user interfaces, see [Language support](../../../../../../deployment/manage/portal_admin_tools/language_support/index.md).

4.  Select **Set Up a Cluster > Database Transfer**.

    !!!note
        The **Database Transfer** configuration option in the Configuration Wizard assigns users and permissions, creates databases, obtains support for database collation, and transfers your database.

5.  Provide information about your environment.

    !!!attention
        Record your database settings so that you can use the same information when you create Portal B. If cluster A exists, upgrade it to match Portal B.

    !!!important
        Maintain the same number of data sources with identical names to the Cluster A data sources. Then, the data source bindings in the applications can be resolved on every cluster. If you share databases across the clusters, this statement refers to both the shared and non-shared domains. All domains must use the same names. For example, if Cluster A uses relDS comDS custDS jcrDS fbkDS lmDS, then Cluster B must also use six data sources with the same names. Cluster B cannot be configured to use a single data source. An enterprise application that is shared between cluster contains only a single binding to a single data source name. An application cannot contain a binding to multiple data source names. If the data source names are the same and the user ID and password are the same, then the extra aliases are not required. The binding in the application resolves to the data source for both clusters because the name is the same and the user ID and password is the same.

6.  Save your configuration settings.

7.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   Click **Download Files** to run the steps remotely.
    -   Click **Run All Steps** to run the steps locally.

## Configuring the multiple cluster

After you create cluster A and portal B, run the various tasks to create the multiple cluster.

1.  Complete the following steps on the primary node of Cluster A:

    Use the same database user ID and password for each identically named domain or data source. It allows the existing JAAS Authentication Aliases to be functional. If a unique database user ID and password are required, more manual configuration is required to create and map JAAS Authentication Aliases for each data source.

    1.  Open a command prompt.

    2.  Change to the wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine directory.

    3.  Run the following task to create the JAAS Authentication Aliases:

        -   AIX® and Linux™: `./ConfigEngine.sh create-alias-multiple-cluster -DauthDomainList=release,jcr -DWasPassword=dmgr_password`
        -   Windows™: `ConfigEngine.bat create-alias-multiple-cluster -DauthDomainList=release,jcr -DWasPassword=dmgr_password`

        Where authDomainList is set to a list of domains that use unique database user ID and passwords. The domain properties are set correctly in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file, including user ID and password.

2.  If necessary, upgrade Portal B to the current fix pack.

3.  Complete the following steps to create an inventory list of Portal B enterprise applications and portlets:

    1.  Open a command prompt on Portal B.

    2.  Change to the wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine directory.

    3.  Run the following task to create the list:

        -   AIX® and Linux™: `./ConfigEngine.sh mapped-app-list-create -DWasPassword=password`
        -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat mapped-app-list-create -DWasPassword=password`

4.  Run the following command from the wp_profile_root/bin directory to federate Portal B:

    ```
    ./addNode.sh dmgr_hostname dmgr_port -includeapps
    	-username was_admin_user
    	-password was_admin_password
    ```

    ```
    addNode.bat dmgr_hostname dmgr_port -includeapps
    	-username was_admin_user
    	-password was_admin_password
    ```

    The variables are defined as:

    -   dmgr_hostname is the TCP/IP host name of the Deployment Manager server
    -   dmgr_port is the SOAP port number of the Deployment Manager server
    -   was_admin_user and was_admin_password are the user ID and password for the Deployment Manager administrator
    
    If the WebSphere Application Server administrator user ID and password are different from the Deployment Manager values, add the following parameters to the addNode task:

    -   -localusername local_was_admin_user
    -   -localpassword local_was_admin_password

    !!!tip
        Read [addNode command](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/rxml_addnode.html) for information about the addNode command and other optional parameters.

    !!!warning
        If the addNode task fails for any reason, you must complete the following steps before you rerun the task:

    1.  Remove the node if the AddNode task succeeded in creating the node.
    2.  If the items exist, log on to the deployment manager and complete the following steps:

        1.  Remove the HCL Portal server definition.
        2.  Remove the HCL Portal JDBC Provider.

5.  Stop the HCL Portal server on the primary node of Cluster B and ensure that the following parameters are set correctly in the wkplc.properties file:

    !!!note
        You can add these parameters (particularly passwords) directly to any task. However, you might want to temporarily add them to the properties file. You can then remove them when you are finished to keep your environment secure.

    1.  Set WasSoapPort to the port used to connect remotely to the deployment manager.

    2.  Set WasRemoteHostName to the full host name of the server that is used to remotely connect to the deployment manager.

    3.  Verify that WasUserid is set to your Deployment Manager administrator user ID.

    4.  Verify that WasPassword is set to your Deployment Manager administrator password.

    5.  Verify that PortalAdminPwd is set to your HCL Portal administrator password.

    6.  Verify that ClusterName is set.

    7.  Verify that PrimaryNode is set to true.

6.  Run the following task to determine which applications from the inventory list are no longer mapped to Portal B. The task uses the application profiles in the cell to restore the mappings.Wait 30 minutes after you run this task to allow all EAR files to expand before you proceed to the next step.

    -   AIX Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh map-apps-to-server -DWasPassword=password`
    -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat map-apps-to-server -DWasPassword=password`

7.  Ensure that all database parameters are correctly set, including passwords, in the wkplc_comp.properties and wkplc_dbtype.properties files on Portal B.

8.  Run the following task on Portal B:

    -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh cluster-node-config-post-federation -DWasPassword=password`
    -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat cluster-node-config-post-federation -DWasPassword=password`

9.  The HCL Portal node is federated. It uses the Deployment Manager cell and its user registry. If the administrative user ID and group name are different between HCL Portal and Deployment Manager, choose one of the following options:

    -   Add the existing administrative user ID and group to the Deployment Manager security configuration
    -   Complete the following steps to change the values in the HCL Portal configuration to match the Deployment Manager values:
        1.  If necessary, start the HCL Portal server.

        2.  Verify that the required HCL Digital Experience administrative user ID and group ID are defined in the Deployment Manager user registry that provides security.

        3.  Run the following task:

            -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh wp-change-portal-admin-user -DWasPassword=password -DnewAdminId=newadminid -DnewAdminPw=newpassword -DnewAdminGroupId=newadmingroupid`
            -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat wp-change-portal-admin-user -DWasPassword=password -DnewAdminId=newadminid -DnewAdminPw=newpassword -DnewAdminGroupId=newadmingroupid`
            
            Where:

            -   `WasPassword` is set to the administrative password for the Deployment Manager cell
            -   `newAdminId` is set to the fully qualified distinguished name (DN) of the HCL Portal administrative user ID in the cell
            -   `newAdminGroupId` is set to the fully qualified DN of the group for the HCL Portal administrative user ID in the cell

                !!!important
                    If the value for newAdminGroupId contains a space; for example, Software Group, open the wkplc.properties file. Add the values for `newAdminId`, `newAdminPw`, and `newAdminGroupId`. Save your changes and then run the `wp-change-portal-admin-user` task.

        4.  After the task completes, stop the HCL Portal server.

10. Complete the following steps from the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console on Portal B:

    1.  Log on to WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console.

    2.  Click **System Administration > Node Agents**.

    3.  Check the box next to the required node agent and then click **Restart**.

11. Stop and restart the deployment manager.

12. Stop and restart the HCL Portal server on Portal B.

13. Restart the HCL Portal server on Cluster A. Verify that Cluster A is functionally intact; check pages and portlets. Verify that Portal B is functionally intact; check the pages and portlets that you deployed into Portal B before it was federated. Any discrepancies or errors must be corrected before you continue.

    !!!note
        If Portal B has an administrative ID other than wpsadmin, the server is not functional. It is functional after the cluster is complete and the administrative ID is configured to match the security settings.

14. Choose one of the following options to define a cluster with Portal B as the basis:

    -   Complete the following steps to define a static cluster:

        -   Run the following task:

            -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh cluster-node-config-cluster-setup -DWasPassword=dmgr_password`
            -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat cluster-node-config-cluster-setup -DWasPassword=dmgr_password`

        -   Configure the cluster to use an external web server to take advantage of features such as workload management. Go to [Configuring a web server and an application server on separate machines (remote)](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/tins_webplugins_remotesa.html) for information.

            !!!note
                Start with the step about starting the plug-ins installation wizard.

    -   Complete the following steps to define a dynamic cluster:

            -   Specify the dynamic cluster properties for the minimum and maximum number of server instances.
            -   Review the summary page to verify your actions and then click **Finish**.
            -   Run the following task to create the dynamic cluster:

                -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh cluster-node-config-dynamic-cluster-setup -DWasPassword=dmgr_password`
                -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat cluster-node-config-dynamic-cluster-setup -DWasPassword=dmgr_password`
                
15. Complete the following steps to access the Web Content Manager content through an external web server:

    1.  Log on to the deployment manager WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console.

    2.  Select **Environment > WebSphere Variables**.

    3.  From the **Scope** menu, select the Node=nodename, Server=servername option to narrow the scope of the listed variables. Node=nodename is the node that contains the HCL Portal application server.

    4.  Update the WCM_HOST variable with the fully qualified host name that is used to access the HCL Portal server through the web server or On Demand Router.

    5.  Update the WCM_PORT variable with the port number used to access the HCL Portal server through the web server or On Demand Router.

    6.  Update the WCM_HOST and WCM_PORT variable for each additional HCL Portal application server that exists in the cluster.

    7.  Synchronize the node with the deployment manager.

    8.  Save your changes and then restart the deployment manager, the node agents, and the HCL Portal servers.

16. Install any additional nodes for Cluster B. Then, federate them as secondary nodes and define them as cluster members on these nodes. You can add more nodes to a static or dynamic cluster. You can also add more vertical cluster members to an existing node in a static or dynamic cluster to provide vertical scaling.

17. Restart the HCL Portal server on Cluster A and Cluster B.

18. After you set up your multiple clusters, complete the extra tasks to ensure a balanced workload and failover support.

    -   Update the web server configuration to enable user requests to be routed to the new cluster. Refer to your web server documentation for information about using a web server with multiple clusters in a cell.
    -   Update your database configuration to share database domains between clusters.
19. If you entered passwords in any of the properties files when you created your cluster, remove them for security purposes.


Deployment of Cluster B is complete. It is now an independent cluster from Cluster A, which means that Cluster B can have its own configuration, set of user portlets, and target community. Any applications that are common between Cluster A and Cluster B are most likely infrastructure or related to administration. Special care must be taken to preserve their commonality between clusters and correct maintenance levels.

## Configuring the web server

Move the web server plug-in from the WebSphere Application Server to the web server.


## Tuning the servers in your environment

Tuning the servers is important to the performance of your portal environment. HCL Digital Experience is not tuned for a production environment after installation and deployment. Your database needs tuning for improved performance. You can organize your database now or soon after you finish your configuration. You need to tune and maintain your database on a regular basis.

1.  Run the performance tuning tool to complete an initial tuning of your servers.

2.  Check the tuning guide for more instructions. Use the tuning guide for the previous product version when the tuning guide for the current release is unavailable.


## Configuring a remote search service

Configure the remote search service to offload and balance system load.

1.  Use the IBM Installation Manager to install the remote search service using the IBM Installation Manager.

2.  If you use single-sign on, prepare the security for the remote search service.

3.  Configure the security between portal and the remote search server.

4.  Set the search user ID.

5.  Configure the remote search service.

6.  Configure the seedlist servlet.
