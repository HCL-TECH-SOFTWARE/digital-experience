# HCL Digital Experience roadmaps for stand-alone servers

A stand-alone server topology is useful for many environments. While the underlying topology is similar for many environments, the configuration steps to achieve a desired environment varies.

-   **[HCL Digital Experience roadmap: Demonstration environment](rm_demo.md)**  
Ideal for running product, feature, and application demos. After installation, you have an Apache Derby database and a default file-based repository.
-   **[Roadmap: Portlet and theme development environment](rm_portlet_theme_dev.md)**  
This HCL Digital Experience roadmap is ideal for running a portlet and theme development server, which is used to develop and test portlets and themes.
-   **[Roadmap: Test or small production environment](rm_test.md)**  
A stand-alone server topology is ideal for a test or small production environment. In this roadmap, the web server, database, and user registry software are distributed to different physical servers.
