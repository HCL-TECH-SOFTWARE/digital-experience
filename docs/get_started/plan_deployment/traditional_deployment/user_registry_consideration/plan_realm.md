# Realm support

A realm is a collection of users or groups from one or more branches of your repository tree. Those branches can be part of a single repository, for example an LDAP user registry, or it can be a combination of multiple user registries. A realm is then mapped to a Virtual Portal to allow the realm's user population to log in to the Virtual Portal. This functionality allows you to define areas within HCL Portal that only a limited set of users can access.

For example, if you are an international company with employees in Asia, Europe, USA, and Canada, you might have an application or information that applies only to a subset of these employees. You can create a subset of employees and create a Virtual Portal that contains the application or information for that realm. Users from one realm cannot access another realm unless they are also members of that realm. For example, the wpsadmin user cannot log in to a Virtual Portal unless the wpsadmin user is a member of the corresponding realm.

You can create a realm that combines users from your various user registries; for example, your realm can span three LDAP user registries and a database user registry: LDAP1, LDAP2, LDAP3, and DB1.

**Remember:** Before you combine multiple user registries, review the registries for the following limitations and correct any issues:

-   Distinguished names must be unique for a realm over all registries. For example, if uid=wpsadmin,o=yourco exists in LDAP1, it must not exist in LDAP2, LDAP3, or DB1.
-   The short name, for example wpsadmin, should be unique for a realm over all registries.
-   The base distinguished names for all registries that are used within a realm must not overlap; for example, if LDAP1 is c=us,o=yourco, LDAP2 must not be o=yourco.
-   Do not leave the base entry blank for any of the registries used within a realm.
-   If HCL® Domino® is one of your user registries in a multiple registry configuration and shares a realm with another user registry, ensure that the groups are stored in a hierarchical format in the Domino Directory as opposed to the default flat-naming structure. For example, the flat-naming convention is cn=groupName and the hierarchical format is cn=groupName,o=root.
-   The user must exist in a user registry and not within the property extension configuration; otherwise, the user cannot be a member of the realm.
