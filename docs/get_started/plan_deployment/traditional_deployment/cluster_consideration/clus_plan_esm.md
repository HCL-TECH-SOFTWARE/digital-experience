# Using external security managers in a cluster

Complete any configuration for an external security manager after you have completed all other setup.

## General considerations

The following considerations apply to all external security managers:

-   When setting up security in a cluster to use an external security manager, ensure that you review and, if required, perform the security configuration on each node in the cluster, as described in the following topics: IBM® Security Access Manager and configuring Computer Associates eTrust SiteMinder for authentication and authorization.
-   When setting up security in a cluster to use an external security manager, ensure that you review and, if required, perform the security configuration on each node in the cluster, as described in Security Access Manager.
-   If you make any changes to the external security manager configuration after initially setting it up, first make the changes in the wkplc\_comp.propreties on the primary node of the cluster. If additional nodes exist in the cluster, ensure that any changes you make to the wkplc\_comp.properties file on the primary node are propagated to the wkplc\_comp.properties file on other nodes in the cluster.

## Security Access Manager cluster considerations

-   Ensure that you run the validate-pdadmin-connection task on each node in the cluster.
-   If the validate-pdadmin-connection task fails, run the run-svrssl-config task before attempting to run validate-pdadmin-connection again. Note that the wp.acc.impl.PDServerName parameter in the wkplc\_comp.properties file represents an individually configured AMJRTE connection to Security Access Manager, and each node in the cluster must have a unique value for wp.acc.impl.PDServerName before running the run-svrssl-config task.
-   If you are using an external Web server, additional configuration is required before running any task to configure an external security manager with a HCL Portal cluster. Edit the wkplc\_comp.properties file on each node, and ensure that the values for the wp.ac.impl.JunctionHost and wp.ac.impl.JunctionPort properties are set to the backend server host name and port number you are using for your Web server.
-   Ensure that the WebSEAL Trust Association Interceptor \(TAI\) parameters, found in the wkplc\_comp.properties file, are the same on each node in the cluster. If you run a configuration task that overwrites the WebSEAL junction, the WebSphere® Application Server TAI properties are not automatically updated. Therefore, you must manually ensure that all nodes are using the same parameters. To manually ensure the nodes are the same, use the Deployment Manager WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console and go to **Security** \> **Global security** \> **Web and SIP Security** \> **Trust Association** \> **Interceptors** \> **com.ibm.sec.authn.tai.TAMETai** \> **Custom properties**.

    !!! note 
        If you are still using the deprecated Trust Association Interceptors \(TAIs\) implementation, go to **Security** \> **Global security** \> **Web and SIP Security** \> **Trust Association** \> **Interceptors** \> **com.ibm.ws.security.web.TAMTrustAssociationInterceptorPlus** \> **Custom properties**.

-   Enter the file location specified by the wp.ac.impl.PDPermPath parameter in the wkplc\_comp.properties file. This property indicates the location of the Security Access Manager AMJRTE properties file \(PdPerm.properties\). In a cluster composed of nodes with different operating systems, the location of the PdPerm.properties file might differ, depending on the node.

    The value for wp.ac.impl.PDPermpath can be set globally for all cluster members. Use the com.ibm.websphere.security.webseal.configURL property, accessed in the Deployment Manager WebSphere Application Server. Go to **Security** \> **Global security** \> **Web and SIP Security** \> **Trust Association** \> **Interceptors** \> **com.ibm.ws.security.web.TAMTrustAssociationInterceptorPlus** \> **Custom properties**. Because the Deployment Manager security configuration is not sensitive to each node's filesystem type, the value for the configURL property must be resolved on each node.

    To ensure that the location of the PdPerm.properties file is properly specified, use one of the following approaches:

    -   If your nodes are all on UNIX™Linux™ platforms, use the UNIXLinux link command \(ln\) to ensure the value for 0.om.hcl.websphere.security.webseal.configURL resolves on each node.
    -   If the PdPerm.properties file location differs on each node and your cluster consists of different platforms, this property can accept a WebSphere Application Server variable to establish a location on each node's file system to correctly reference the file.

## eTrust SiteMinder cluster considerations

Ensure that you have installed and validated the eTrust SiteMinder binaries on each node in the cluster. If you are only using eTrust SiteMinder for authentication, install and validate the Application Server Agent. If you are using eTrust SiteMinder for authentication and authorization, both the Application Server Agent and the SDK must be installed and validated.
