## Overview

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to **develop, deploy, and run** applications with containers. Containerization is the use of Linux containers to deploy applications. While the use of containers to deploy applications is not new, containers are favored due to the ease of deploying applications like the latest version of HCL Digital Experience.

The HCL Digital Experience containers are launched by running a runtime instance of an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 application, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Because it runs a discrete process, it does not take any more memory other than the executable image with state or user process.
