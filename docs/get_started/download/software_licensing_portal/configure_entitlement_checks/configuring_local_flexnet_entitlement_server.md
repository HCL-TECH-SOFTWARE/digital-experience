# Configuring a local HCL Flexnet entitlement server
You may optionally configure a local HCL Flexnet entitlement server to more strictly control the environment in which your entitlement checks are made, by your HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 Kubernetes production environments.

This process allows you to remain in entitlement compliance without the need for outbound connections to the HCL-hosted Flexnet entitlement service from your HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 Kubernetes production installations.

A local Flexnet entitlement server can itself also be configured to function without the need for outbound connections, with the offline version of the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server. 

!!!important
    With outbound connections disabled, however, a member of your development team is required to manually update the local entitlement server periodically with the HCL Software License Portal, to verify entitlements with HCL.

## Before you begin

-   Obtain the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server software and the installation readme files from the [HCL License and Delivery Portal](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do). The download package, `HCL Common Local License Server 2.0`, can be found under **Uncategorized Products**.

    !!!important
        Do not attempt to download the software by searching for the package name. The resulting package, `HCL_CLLS_Beta`, is not the correct package.

-   Review the following documentation on how to configure a server-based (online) or local license (offline) server: 

    - For Linux Server: [How to install HCL Local License Server on Linux](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0090792)
    - For Windows Server: [How to install HCL Local License Server on Windows Operating System](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0082090)

    These guides can be used as the primary source documents for the installation and configuration of your HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server.

-   Review the readme documents, or the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server installation guide, and the specific requirements for using the HCL Embedded License Server with HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 production environments as highlighted in the following task steps. 

    With a better understanding of the requirements, configurations, and limitations of this software, create a plan for entitlement checks for your organization. You can also choose to combine the use of both the local HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server and remote HCL-hosted Flexnet entitlement server across your production environments, depending on the requirements of your organization.

-   Ensure that you have a local machine that meets the requirements for the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server software. 

    These requirements are highlighted in detail on pages 22-24 of the installation guide.

## Procedure

1. Install, configure, and start the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server software.

    Use the `Windows ReadMe.docx` or `Linux ReadMe.docx` instructions that are included within the package. 

    Optionally, the [HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server installation guide](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/install/pdf/FlexNet%20Embedded%20License%20Server%20Administration%20Guide.pdf) is available for more detailed steps and information on this process.

    !!!important
        -   Before installing and running the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server service on your host operating system, ensure that you review [Configuring SSL certificates for use with a local HCL Flexnet entitlement server](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/install/tasks/tentitlementcheckconfigurelocalcerts.html) for the required SSL certificates to be generated and included for use on the dependent HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 production environments, and on the local license server itself.

        -   Once configured and registered on the [HCL License and Delivery Portal](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do), your local license server cannot be migrated or duplicated on another machine. Changes to the network configuration of the host machine can also result in invalidation of the local license server. If you make changes to the local license server that is in use for your organization, ensure that it is correctly registered with HCL.

    Confirm that the service is running.

    -   On a Windows-based server:

        -   In a command prompt, run `services.msc`.

        -   Confirm the service, `FNLS-HCL`, is listed and running.

    -   On a Linux-based server:

        -   In a command prompt, run `sudo systemctl -l status flexnetls-HCL`.

            The response should look similar to the following, which contains all information on the running service:

            ```

            ```

    Additionally, you can view the logs for the local license service. The default log locations are as follows:

    -   Windows: `C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\flexnetls\producer_name\logs\`

    -   Linux: /var/opt/flexnetls/producer_name/logs/

2. Obtain the information required to register the local license server with the [HCL License and Delivery Portal](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do).

    1.  Using the default user name and password, request a bearer token from the local license server.

        ```
        curl -k --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data "{\"user\":\"admin\",\"password\":\HCLDefault@\"}" https://<license server hostname>:<port>/api/1.0/instances/~/authorize
        ```

        Where:

        -   `<license server hostname>` is the host name of the local license server.

        -   `<port>` is the configured port number for the local license service.

    2.  Extract the **hostids** value from the local license server.
        
        Using the token value obtained in the previous step, obtain the **hostids**.

        ```
        curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <token value>" https://<license server hostname>:<port>/api/1.0/hostids
        ```
        Where:

        -   `<token value>` is the token.
        -   `<license server hostname>` is the hostname of the local license server.
        -   `<port>` is the configured port number for the local license service.

        The value that you are looking for is the 12-character **hostids** value. For example,

        ```
        ...
        {
        "hostids" : [ {
            "type" : "ETHERNET",
            "value" : "DE32822D0EA"
        }, {
        ...
        ```

3. Register your local license server on the [HCL License and Delivery Portal](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do), associate it with your licenses, and download the capability response file to configure your local license server with your entitlement information.

    1. Create the local license server on the HCL License and Delivery Portal.

        1.  Log in to the HCL License and Delivery Portal.
        
        2.  Under the top tab drop down selections, select **Devices > Create Device**. The **New Device** page is displayed.
        
        3. Fill out the required fields.
            
            1. Name the license server.
            
            2. Check the **Runs license server?** check box.
            
            3. Leave the **ID Type** as `ETHERNET`.
            
            4. Under the **ID** field, enter the **hostids** value that you obtained.
        
        4. Click **Save**. The device is created.

    2. Map your HCL HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 entitlements to the local license server. Reference the table: [HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 Tier 1 – 7 parts and HCL Flexnet License Server Feature Name](index.md) for details.
        
        1. On the device page, select **Action > Map Entitlements**.
        
        2. Associate the HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 licenses with your local license server by adding values to the **Qty to add** column.
        
        3. Click **Save**. The licenses are associated with the license server.

    3. Download the capability response (`.bin`) file to update the entitlements on your local license server.

        On the device page, select **Action > Download Capability Response**. A download .bin file is produced. The file name will match the **hostid** value for your local license server.

4. Upload the capability response (`.bin`) file to your local license server to configure your local license entitlements.
    
    1. Copy the downloaded file into the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server installation configuration directory.Typically these are similar to the following:
    
    -   Windows: `C:\HCL_CLLS-x64-windows-2018.02-online\server\`
    
    -   Linux: `/opt/flexnetls/HCL/`
    
    2. Upload the capability response (.bin) file into the server.

        ```
        curl -k -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token value>" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" --data-binary "@<Bin File Name.bin>" https://<license server hostname>:<port>/api/1.0/capability_response
        ```

        Where:
        -   `<token value>` is the token.
        -   `<Bin File Name.bin>` is the capability response file.
        -   `<license server hostname>` is the hostname of the local license server.
        -   `<port>` is the configured port number for the local license service.

        The expected HTTP response is:
        
        ```
        "confirmationRequestNeeded" : false
        ```

        You can also observe the update directly within your local license server logs.
    
    3. Change the default administrator password to secure your local license server.

        See page 64 in the HCL Flexnet Embedded License Server installation guide.

5. Once the local Flexnet license server is verified up and running, obtain the server details:

    -   Username (by default this is set to 'admin', and per #6 above should be changed)

    -   Password

    -   SSL certificate (This was the certificate generated in the setup. This will be imported to the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 License manager deployment to enable the SSL connection). Refer to the **Architecture** figure below.

## Architecture

The License Manager component communicates with the local license server to validate license entitlement periods for HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native V9.5 Tier 1 – 7 software configured for Production Use. The local license server stores user session consumption from the customer’s production DX Cloud Native 9.5 deployments and will synchronize that data from the local license server copy to the HCL Flexnet License Portal Server when those connections are periodically established. 

![Architecture](../_img/architecture_logical_deployment_kube.png)

## Procedure

1. To configure optional use of a local Flexnet license server, a property is added to the DX 9.5 Kubernetes Helm configuration to map the local license server SSL certificate (stored in a Kubernetes secret) to an environment variable. This property is optional and the DX 9.5 license manager instance will then automatically run an import to the `cacerts truststore` script if the variable contains any value.

    ```
    # License Certificate secret used for Local license server
    licenseCertSecret: "license-secret"
    ```

2. As detailed in the [HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 entitlement checks](index.md) topic, you need to configure the following items to your DX 9.5 Container Update CF207 or later Helm chart according to the DX Cloud Native 9.5 entitlement(s) (Tier 1 – 7) you are entitled to and have mapped to your Local License Server instance:

    1. `productionEnvironment:true` - Configure this variable to true if this deployment will be used to support a Production deployment. See the [HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native v9.5 license document](https://www.hcltechsw.com/wps/wcm/connect/61f40a7e-d2ca-42d4-b24c-d5adfd4fe54d/HCL+Digital+Experience+Cloud+Native+v9.5.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-61f40a7e-d2ca-42d4-b24c-d5adfd4fe54d-n-MmIad) for the definitions of production and non-production deployments.

    2. `licenseServer ID` – configure to your Local License Server ID. Note that the Server ID is not the Host ID that you have provided in Flexnet Portal but the Server ID of Local license server. To check, run a curl command to the license server health and server details will be shown:

    ```
    curl -k https://yourhostname:port/api/1.0/health
    Sample server response:

    "LLS" : {
        "version" : "2021.05.0",
        "buildDate" : "2021-04-21T09:39:52Z",
        "buildVersion" : "266216",
        "branch" : "master",
        "gitHash" : "7967ed0b40e07ef5c28eda34da21f5a20b91f04e",
        "patch" : "0",
        "fneBuildVersion" : "266165",
        "serverInstanceID" : "V2YPFFXBK91E",
        "database" : {
        "connectionCheck" : "success"
        },
        "security" : "enabled",
        "httpAuth" : "disabled",
        "licensingSecurityJSON" : "enabled",
        "diskspace" : "ok"
    }
    ```

    3. `licenseServer URL` – verify your connection to the Local License Server URL.

    4. `licenseFeatureNameWithVersion` – Configure this variable according to the [HCL DX Cloud Native 9.5 Tier 1 – 7](../../../product_overview/offerings.md#hcl-digital-experience-cloud-native) offering part your organization has acquired and is mapped to your HCL Flexnet server instance(s). See Table [HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 Tier 1 – 7 parts and Flexnet License Server Feature Name](../configure_entitlement_checks/index.md#procedure).

    5. `licenseManagerUser` – Configure this variable with the user name of the administrator authenticated to manage your Local License Server. (This is by default set to 'admin')

    6. `licenseManagerPassword` – Configure this variable with the password associated with the user name of the administrator to manage your Local License Server defined in the previous step.

3. Manually import the generated SSL certificate for the local license server to the Kubernetes secret. As mentioned in Step 1, use the default secret name 'license-secret' or change the `licenseCertSecret` in the custom values according to your secret name. The key name in the secret must be set to `license-secret`:

    ```
    kubectl -n <namespace> create secret generic license-secret --from-file=license-secret=hostname.certs 
    ```

4.  Run a Helm upgrade and restart the DX license manager pod.

    To run helm upgrade:
    ```
    helm upgrade -n <namespace> -f current.yaml <deployment-name> install-hcl-dx-deployment
    ```

    To restart the DX license manager pod:
    ```
    kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart sts <deployment-name>-license-manager
    ```

## Results

Ensure that your connection to the local Flexnet license server is successful by viewing your HCL DX 9.5 Container Update Server License Manager pod logs.

Use `kubectl` logs for the license manager pod. For example:

```
kubectl logs pod/dx-deployment-license-manager-0 -n <namespace>
```
