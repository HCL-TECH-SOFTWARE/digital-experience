title:  Entitlement checking in the My HCLSoftware delivery portal
---

My HCLSoftware (MHS) provides access to various customer-facing systems such as Downloads, Software Entitlements, eCommerce, Support, Subscriptions, Account Management, Marketplace, and more. In MHS, you can find and download the latest HCLSoftware product releases and supported older releases. This topic provides information on how you can check your entitlements in the My HCLSoftware delivery portal. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following elements before configuring the HCL Digital Experience (DX) Cloud Native V9.5 entitlements to be deployed on supported Kubernetes platforms using My HCLSoftware delivery portal for entitlement checking:  

-   A My HCLSoftware account and access to the [My HCLSoftware](https://support.hcl-software.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0109011){target="_blank"} portal.
-   A valid [HCL DX Cloud Native 9.5 (Tier 1 – 7)](https://www.hcltechsw.com/wps/wcm/connect/61f40a7e-d2ca-42d4-b24c-d5adfd4fe54d/HCL+Digital+Experience+Cloud+Native+v9.5.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-61f40a7e-d2ca-42d4-b24c-d5adfd4fe54d-n-MmIad){target="_blank"} offering part purchased and issued by the HCL Software licensing team.
-   Your DX Cloud Native 9.5 (Tier 1 – 7) entitlements are mapped to your My HCLSoftware portal instances.  
-   A plan to deploy or update to [HCL DX 9.5 Container Update CF226](../../../../whatsnew/cf20/newcf226.md) or to a later release, if currently using a prior version.
-   An instance deployment. To create an instance deployment, refer to the steps in [Creating a deployment](../../software_licensing_portal/configure_entitlement_checks/create_deployment_mhs_ui.md) in [My HCLSoftware Portal](https://my.hcltechsw.com/).

In addition to these elements, review the [architecture](#architecture) that presents the License Manager component of the HCL DX v9.5 Container Update software.

## Architecture

The License Manager component communicates with the My HCLSoftware entitlement service. This is to validate license entitlement at set periods for HCL DX Cloud Native V9.5 Tier 1 – 7 software after configuring the DX Cloud Native 9.5 deployment through the Helm chart. The License Manager component also transmits user session consumption from your production DX Cloud Native 9.5 deployments to the My HCLSoftware usage reporting services.

![Architecture](../../software_licensing_portal/_img/DX_95_container_license_manager_arch_mhs.png) 

Follow the configuration steps in [Configuring the DX Cloud Native 9.5 entitlement](#configuring-the-dx-cloud-native-95-entitlement) before you deploy a new or update an existing DX 9.5 Container deployment. By completing these steps, you configure the DX Cloud Native 9.5 Tier 1 – 7 deployment using a Helm chart and enable the License Manager entitlement-checking functions.  

## Configuring the DX Cloud Native 9.5 entitlement

To validate the entitlement details for your software, configure the following properties in the Helm chart:

```yaml

# License Manager Configuration
  licenseManager:
    # Configures if this environment is a production environment.
    # For non production environments sessions are not counted but the license
    # is still validated.
    productionEnvironment: true
    # MHS License Server URI
    licenseServerUri: ""
    # Custom Deployment key secret for MHS deployment instance
    customMhsDeploymentKeySecret: ""
    # Deployment key for MHS deployment instance
    mhsDeploymentKey: ""

```

-   `productionEnvironment`: Set to `true` to send usage reports to MHS. For other environments (for example, test or UAT), set to `false`.
-   `licenseServerUri`: Set to the MHS License Server URI.
-   `customMhsDeploymentKeySecret`: Set to the deployment key that creates a custom secret name. Any method can use `customMhsDeploymentKeySecret` or `mhsDeploymentKey` for the deployment key.
-   `mhsDeploymentKey`: Set to the credentials for product deployments. Any method can use `customMhsDeploymentKeySecret` or `mhsDeploymentKey` for the deployment key. You can obtain the deployment key from [My HCLSoftware Portal](https://my.hcltechsw.com/).

To create a custom secret, run the following command:

```sh
#Example to create custom secret
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=deploymentKey=<deploymentKey> --namespace=<namespace>
```

## Validating the DX Cloud Native 9.5 deployment entitlement

To validate your entitlement, you must check the logs generated by the License Manager component. The following sample command uses `kubectl` to fetch the logs from a specific pod within a Kubernetes namespace.

```sh
 #Example to get logs:
 kubectl logs pod/dx-deployment-license-manager-0 --namespace=<namespace>
``` 

### Expected logs

This section shows what a successful entitlement check should look like. The logs should indicate a successful connection to the entitlement server, as illustrated in the following example:

```log
INFO: The connection to the entitlement server is successful. You have a valid HCL Digital Experience Cloud Native 9.5 entitlement. HCL DX Cloud Native 9.5 server starts.
INFO: Starting session count of the license manager
INFO: License validity: true
```
