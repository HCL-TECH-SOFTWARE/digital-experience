# Digital Asset Management

HCL Digital Experience (DX) provides integrated Digital Asset Management (DAM) services, which are targeted at managing web-ready digital assets such as images or videos for use in content and sites built with HCL DX.

View the demonstration of the HCL DX DAM features and capabilities in [HCL DX Digital Asset Management](https://hclsoftware.storylane.io/share/d6h8zcuwv68v){target="_blank"}.

## Content organization and access

Assets are organized into collections, and access can be controlled to the top-level set of collections. Within a collection, you can create sub-collections so you can keep your content organized. Each collection can store images, videos, and other files.

## Rendition generation

For images stored in the DAM, renditions are automatically generated for desktop, smartphone, and tablet. The sizes generated can be customized and additional renditions configured. Individual images can be cropped in DAM without spending time in an image editing software.

## Integrations

As delivered with HCL DX, DAM provides two integrations.

* Video file management can be delegated to the [Kaltura video content management system](https://corp.kaltura.com/video-content-management-system/). When this system is configured, videos are synchronized with Kaltura and can be delivered through that service. With this setup, you can deliver adaptive video in your web experiences.
* Image assets can be automatically tagged by using [Google Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detect-labels-image-api). With tagging, you can enrich the metadata available for images stored in DAM.

You can customize or replace both integrations with your preferred solutions.

## Extensibility

DAM supports user-defined custom renditions and transformations for images. This feature can be used to integrate with third-party plug-ins for custom asset processing. For example, custom renditions and transformations can be used for resizing, cropping, rotating, or custom operations, while supporting default and custom renditions.
