# DXClient

HCL Digital Experience (DX) includes DXClient, a consolidated application and system management utility. Using DXClient, developers and administrators can deploy changes to the DX platform and automate development and delivery processes. You can also use it to manage tasks, such as uploading portlets or script applications and managing the DX server. This tool takes artifacts developed locally and deploys them to DX 9.5 servers on supported on-premises platforms, including standalone, cluster, and Kubernetes deployments.

Sample pipelines are provided to enable customers to easily integrate DXClient into their CI/CD processes.
