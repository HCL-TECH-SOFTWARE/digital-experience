# Change of theme for virtual portal might not take effect

If you change the theme for a virtual portal by editing the virtual portal in the Virtual Portals portlet, this change affects only the root page of the virtual portal.

If pages in your virtual portal have explicitly assigned themes, updating the theme for the virtual portal by using the Virtual portals portlet does not alter these pages. To change the theme for such pages of a virtual portal, edit the pages by using the user interface, or use the XML configuration interface \(XML Access\).
