# Creating new search collections

Before you can begin using remote search service, you must create two new search collections, one for JCR search, and one for Portal search.

1.  Manually create a JCR search collection by following the instructions that are outlined in *Setting up a JCR search collection* in the related links.

    **Important:** The steps that are outlined in *Setting up a JCR search collection* include instructions on how to create the new content source for the JCR search collection. Create the new content source for the JCR search collection before you create the Portal search collection.

2.  Manually create a Portal search collection by completing the following steps:

    1.  To open the **Manage Search** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Search Administration** \> **Manage Search**.

    2.  Click **Search collections.**

    3.  To create a new search collection, click **New collection**.

    4.  Specify the following values for the parameters as required:

        -   **Location of collection**

            The directory location for the collection where you intend the search collection to be created. This parameter is to be specified as index directory location/collection name.

            Specify the name of the collection.

    5.  Click **OK**.

        The collection displays in the Collections from All Services pane.
