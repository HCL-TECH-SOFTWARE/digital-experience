# Troubleshooting the cache 

In general, you should monitor the cache hit rate on the proxy server and adjust the cache size appropriately. If the hit rate is not what you expected, increase the cache size.

You can also check the following item:

-   Ensure that the cache settings for all portlets on the page are consistent with the cache settings for the page. For example, if one portlet on a page is set to only be cached in a private browser cache, then the entire page can only be cached in a private browser cache, and performance is not optimal.
