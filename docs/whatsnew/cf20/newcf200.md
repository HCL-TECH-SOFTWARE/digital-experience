## Deploy HCL DX 9.5 Container Update to container platforms using Helm

Beginning with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF196, administrators can deploy HCL DX 9.5 CF196 and later images to supported container platforms using Helm. Using a Helm Chart deployment can provide administrators more transparency and control in deployment operations. Beginning with Container Update CF200, new servies and updates include support for Sidecars for logging of Remote Search, define central logs location, Incubator section for future DX 9.5 Container Update features, Configuration of labels and annotations, also environment variables for different DX resources, Use of  Persistent Volumes for DX 9.5 Core, Digital Asset Management, and Persistence services file storage, migration process for the Core profile from Operator to Helm deployment, and Helm based Version to Version Update process.

!!!important
        Beginning with HCL DX Container Update CF200, use of the Operator (dxctl) method of container deployment is not supported. Customers should use Helm deployments and migrate existing Operator-based deployments to Helm.

See the [HCL DX 9.5 Helm deployment](../../get_started/plan_deployment/hybrid_deployment/index.md) topic for more information. 

## Digital Asset Management

New Digital Asset Management (DAM) staging support enables administrators to stage and synchronize DAM assets from an authoring environment (source environment/publisher) to multiple rendering environments (target environment/subscriber), using DXClient.

See the [DAM staging](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/staging_dam/dam_subscription_staging.md) Help Center topic for more information.

Support to migrate from the old to new Digital Asset Management database in the Helm-based deployments. See the [Migrate to new DAM DB in Helm-based deployments](../../deployment/install/container/operator-migration/helm_dam_migration_newDB.md) Help Center topic for more information.

## Enhancements to DXClient

The HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DXClient and DXConnect servlet provides developers and administrators an approach to deploy changes or improvements to the HCL Digital Experience platform, and to automate processes in the development and delivery process. Updates include process definitions to automate Export or Import of Web Content Manager libraries from source server to target server location, also ability to generate differential reports for DX Server configurations.

See the [DXClient and DXConnect tooling supporting CICD release processes](../../extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/index.md) topic for more information.

## New User and Groups REST API Explorer

The remote PUMA SPI gives you access to user profiles through REST services. It provides a remote interface for user and group management for the configured HCL DX user repository. Beginning with HCL DX 9.5 Container Update and CF 199, a new API explorer is available that allows developers using the Portal User Interface APIs to explore and test these APIs. See the Help Center topic [Remote REST service for PUMA](../../extend_dx/apis/puma_spi/remote_rest_service_for_puma/index.md) for additional information.

## New Personalization REST APIs and Explorer

Beginning with HCL DX 9.5 Container Update and CF200, a new API explorer is available that allows developers using the new Digital Experience Personalization REST APIs to explore and test these APIs.
