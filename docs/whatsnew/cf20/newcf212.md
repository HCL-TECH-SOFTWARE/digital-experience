## Digital Experience 9.5 Container Version

### Transition to use of relative hostnames

=== "Containers"
    We are transitioning to using relative hostnames in the configuration. This is to enable the use of multiple hostnames for Kubernetes-based deployments. This transition begins with Content Composer and Digital Asset Management having relative hostnames as their default configuration. Kubernetes-based deployments should continue to work as intended without any changes.

    !!! note "Action Required for Hybrid Deployments"

        The FQDN must be set because hybrid deployments need absolute hostnames. These deployments will fail if this is not set. The use of multiple hostnames is currently not available for any kind of hybrid deployment. See the [Hybrid Host Configurations](../../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/mandatory_tasks/prepare_configure_networking/#hybrid-host) for more details.

### Configuration options for DAM Staging

=== "Containers"
    We have introduced configuration options for hostname, port, and SSL details for DAM Staging. Kubernetes-based deployments should continue to work as intended without any changes. See the topic [Configure staging hostname](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/staging_dam/dam_subscription_staging.md#configure-staging-hostname) for more information.

    !!! note "Action Required for Hybrid Deployments"

        Host details must be configured for hybrid deployments. See the [DAM Staging host Configurations](../../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/staging_dam/dam_subscription_staging/#configure-staging-hostname) for more information.

### Rendition Version Regeneration and Cleanup

=== "Containers"
    A new feature that allows to regenerate renditions and versions of broken assets and to clean up invalid assets is now available. For instructions on how to enable this feature, see the topic [Rendition Version Regeneration and Cleanup](../../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/rendition_version_regeneration_and_cleanup).

### DAM Limitation on CF upgrades

=== "Containers"
    Upgrading DAM from CF204 or below to CF208 or above has limitations. For more instructions on how to handle the upgrade, see the topic [Limitations](../../manage_content/digital_assets/limitations/index.md).
