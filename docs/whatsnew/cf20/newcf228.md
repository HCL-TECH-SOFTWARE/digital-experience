## Digital Experience 8.5 and 9.0 Versions

### Extended Support option now available for DX versions 8.5 and 9.0

=== "On-Premises"
    HCLSoftware announced End of Support for HCL Digital Experience versions 8.5 and 9, effective June 30, 2025. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to HCL Digital Experience version 9.5, released in a continuous delivery model. Refer to the [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md) page for more information.

Extended support will be offered from June 30, 2025 until June 30, 2026.
    
### Automatically apply 9.5 from a later CF installation

=== "On-Premises"
    In CF219, a feature was introduced where [DX version 9.5 is automatically applied](../../deployment/install/traditional/cf_install/index.md) to an 8.5 or 9.0 installation if the configuration setting `install_95=true` is set. Note that a later CF might apply 9.5 by default unless you set `install_95=false`. This statement is not a guarantee of future releases or their features.

## Digital Experience 9.5 Container Version

### DAM - New parameter for bulk upload warning

=== "Containers"
    You can now configure a warning to appear if the number of rich media assets intended for bulk upload exceeds a certain limit using the `maxBulkUploadWithoutWarning` parameter. You can configure this parameter in Helm. For more information, refer to [Uploading rich media assets](../../manage_content/digital_assets/usage/managing_dam/upload_rich_media_assets.md).

### Notice of deprecation of non-OCI-based registry for Harbor Helm chart repository

=== "Containers"
    Starting CF216, the Harbor repository is updated with an OCI-based registry and the Helm chart command is updated to be OCI-compliant. Instructions on how to pull Helm charts using OCI commands are now available. For more information, see the Help Center topics [Configure Harbor Helm Repository](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/get_the_code/configure_harbor_helm_repo.md) and [Download and Deploy from HCL Harbor Repository](../../get_started/download/harbor_container_registry.md).

### Removal of automated Pod restart on ConfigMap updates

=== "Containers"
    Runtime Controller triggering Pod restarts for [direct configuration changes](../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/index.md#rollout-of-configuration-changes) in ConfigMaps is removed. You must restart the appropriate Pods manually to apply the changes made to the ConfigMaps for testing configurations. For more information, see [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md).

### WAS, JDK, and iFix versions

=== "Containers"
    HCL DX 9.5 CF228 contains the following:

    - [WebSphere Application Server 9.0.5.23](../../get_started/system_requirements/traditional/supported_config.md#websphere-application-server)
    - [Java Development Kit 8.0.8.40](../../get_started/system_requirements/traditional/supported_config.md#java-sdk)
