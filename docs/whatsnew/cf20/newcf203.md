## Deploy HCL DX 9.5 Container Update to container platforms using Helm 

Beginning with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF196, administrators can deploy HCL DX 9.5 CF196 and later images to the supported container platforms using Helm. Deployment using the Helm Chart can provide administrators more transparency and control in the deployment operations. 

Beginning with Container Update CF203, the Ambassador shipped as part of the DX Helm deployment is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent HCL DX 9.5 Container Update release. HAProxy is taking its place and replaces functions performed by the Ambassador in the DX namespace.

In CF203, Helm configuration settings for metrics are enabled by default, new guidance is added to deploy to an internal network, and guidance is provided explaining the process to migrate from the Ambassador to new HAProxy service.

See the following Help Center topics [HCL DX 9.5 Kubernetes](../../deployment/install/container/index.md), [Monitoring](../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/monitoring/monitor_helm_deployment_metrics.md), [Deploying DX on internal network](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/optional_tasks/optional_internal_networking.md), and [Migrate from Ambassador to HAProxy](../../deployment/install/container/haproxy-migration/haproxy-introduction.md) for more information.
