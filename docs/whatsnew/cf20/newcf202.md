## Digital Asset Management

New Digital Asset Management (DAM) capability enables developers and release managers to use the DXClient capability to Export and Import DAM assets from source to a File system and Import from File system to target DX 9.5 deployment. Enhancements are also available for content authors to fix the duplicate DAM asset names in a particular collection, and there are new DAM APIs that allow you to access the assets by versions, name, and as reflected in the friendly URLs.
