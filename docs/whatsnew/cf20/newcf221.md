### New options for installing DXClient

=== "Containers"
    You can now install DXClient [from the NpmJS public registry](../../extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/index.md#installing-or-uninstalling-dxclient-from-npmjs-registry) or [from the container image in the public Harbor repository](../../extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/index.md#installing-dxclient-using-the-container-image-in-the-harbor-repository). The open distribution of DXClient makes it easier for DX developers to download and work with the tool. Previously, developers need Administrator access to get DXClient.

    After openly distributing DXClient, the versioning format is now changed from 1.xx.x to <CFNumber\>.x.x. For CF221, the DXClient version is 221.0.0. For more information, see [DXClient](../../extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/index.md).

    In CF219, a feature was introduced where [DX version 9.5 is automatically applied](../../deployment/install/traditional/cf_install/index.md) to an 8.5 or 9.0 installation if the configuration setting `install_95=true` is set. Note that starting with the next DX release, CF222, 9.5 is applied by default unless you set `install_95=false`.

## Digital Experience 9.5 Container Version

### Newly created virtual Portals now contain Practitioner Studio

=== "Containers"
    Starting CF221, the Virtual Portal Manager is configured to use the file `WebSphere:assetname=VirtualPortal.zip:InitVirtualContentPortalV9.5NoWoodburn.xml` on newly deployed containers so that newly created virtual Portals contain Practitioner Studio. For more information, see [Configuring Practitioner Studio](../../build_sites/practitioner_studio/working_with_ps/config_prac_studio.md).

### HCL DX on AWS Marketplace now available

=== "Containers"
    HCL DX Cloud Native is live and listed in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xxxuhyr7adj3a). This allows customers with AWS agreements to simplify procurement and manage their software through one centralized account. For customers who purchase DX through the Marketplace as a containerized product offering, you can download the latest DX 9.5 container images and Helm charts. For instructions on how to deploy HCL DX acquired from the AWS Marketplace, see [AWS Marketplace Helm deployment](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/aws_marketplace_helm_deployment.md).

### New parameter for configuring HAProxy networking

=== "Containers"
    New parameter `sessionCookieName` is now available when you configure HAProxy networking. There is also additional information added for the `strictTransportSecurity.enabled` parameter. For more information, see [Configure Networking](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/mandatory_tasks/prepare_configure_networking.md#configure-haproxy-networking).

### New documentation about the types of Services used in DX

=== "Containers"
    In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster. The topic [Types of Services used in DX](../../get_started/plan_deployment/container_deployment/service_types.md) provides more information about these Services.

### Digital Asset Management - Indexing

=== "Containers"
    You can use Digital Asset Management (DAM) as a datasource of the [Search](../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/configure_opensearch/run_search_queries_api.md) service for you to search DAM assets and images more efficiently. For instructions on how to configure and use indexing in DAM, see [DAM Indexing](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/dam_indexing/index.md).

### Downloading a mismatch report even if find mismatch process is not complete

=== "Containers" 
    You can use the `-forceDownload <value>` attribute to download a mismatch report even if the find mismatch process is not complete. Documentation is also updated to list the scenarios where you cannot download a mismatch report. For more information, see [DAM Staging Mismatch and Resync](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/staging_dam/dam_staging_mismatch.md#download-mismatch-report).

<!--### New guidance for performance sizing for rendering in medium configuration

    Results of DX sizing tests for rendering with a medium configuration are now available. This guidance presents the important KPIs and discusses how adjustments to the pod configuration can make significant improvements in the responsiveness of the system. For more information, see the topic [Performance-sizing guidance for rendering with a medium configuration](../../get_started/plan_deployment/container_deployment/rm_container/dx_performance_medium_cfg.md).-->

### Notice of deprecation of non-OCI-based registry for Harbor Helm chart repository

=== "Containers"
    Starting CF216, the Harbor repository is updated with an OCI-based registry and the Helm chart command is updated to be OCI-compliant. Instructions on how to pull Helm charts using OCI commands are now available.

### Notice of deprecation of customized OpenLDAP container starting CF223

=== "Containers"
    Starting CF223, HCL DX will no longer build and ship its custom OpenLDAP container and will instead use an open source container. By using the robust and well-maintained Bitnami&copy; OpenLDAP image, HCL DX can focus on delivering enhanced features and support without the overhead of maintaining its customized container. This shift is to provide you with more reliable and up-to-date solutions for your test environments. The new alternative, Bitnami&copy;, will be provided but will not ship with the release. Sample LDIF files for your OpenLDAP configuration will also be available.
    
### Removal of automated Pod restart on ConfigMap updates

=== "Containers"
    Runtime Controller triggering Pod restarts for [direct configuration changes](../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/index.md#rollout-of-configuration-changes) in ConfigMaps is removed.
