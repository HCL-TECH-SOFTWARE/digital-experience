Customers are encouraged to upgrade to HCL Digital Experience version 9.5, released in a continuous delivery model. Refer to the [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md) page for more information.
    
### Automatically apply 9.5 from CF223 installation

=== "On-Premises"
    In CF219, a feature was introduced where [DX version 9.5 is automatically applied](../../deployment/install/traditional/cf_install/index.md) to an 8.5 or 9.0 installation if the configuration setting `install_95=true` is set. Note that starting with the next DX release, CF223, 9.5 is applied by default unless you set `install_95=false`.

## Digital Experience 9.5 Container Version

### Values moved from incubator to the main section of `values.yaml`

=== "Containers"
    Values for heartbeat intervals and threshold times are moved from the incubator to the main section. If those values are changed in your [`values.yaml` or custom `values.yaml` file](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/mandatory_tasks/prepare_configuration.md#helm-chart-valuesyaml), adjust them accordingly. For more information, see [Cleanup and Rendition Version Regeneration](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/rendition_version_regeneration_and_cleanup.md).

### DAM Indexing - Updated API endpoints 

=== "Containers" 
    The API endpoint used for [creating the `damContentSourceID`](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/dam_indexing/configure_dam_indexing.md#configuring-dam-indexing) is now `/dx/api/search/v2/contentsources` while the endpoint for [starting the reindexing process](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/dam_indexing/using_dam_indexing.md#reindexing) is `/dx/api/dam/v1/reindex`. 

### New sizing guidance for rendering in a medium configuration

=== "Containers"    
    Results of DX sizing tests for rendering in a Kubernetes medium configuration are now available. This guidance presents the key performance indicators (KPIs) and discusses how adjustments to the pod configuration can make improvements in the responsiveness of the system. For more information, see the topic [Sizing guidance for rendering in a Kubernetes medium configuration](../../guide_me/performance_tuning/kubernetes/rendering_medium_config.md).

### Documentation for using Logstash to push pod logs to OpenSearch

=== "Containers"
    As applications scale, managing Kubernetes logs is important for monitoring, debugging, and compliance. The new topic [Using Logstash to push pod logs to OpenSearch]() outlines the steps for configuring Logstash and Filebeat so that Kubernetes pod logs are forwarded to OpenSearch, an open source search and analytics engine. 

### Notice of deprecation of non-OCI-based registry for Harbor Helm chart repository

=== "Containers"
    Starting CF216, the Harbor repository is updated with an OCI-based registry and the Helm chart command is updated to be OCI-compliant. Instructions on how to pull Helm charts using OCI commands are now available. For more information, see the Help Center topics [Configure Harbor Helm Repository](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/get_the_code/configure_harbor_helm_repo.md) and [Download and Deploy from HCL Harbor Repository](../../get_started/download/harbor_container_registry.md).
    
### Notice of deprecation of customized OpenLDAP container starting CF223

=== "Containers"
    Starting CF223, HCL DX will no longer build and ship its custom OpenLDAP container and will instead use an open source container. By using the robust and well-maintained Bitnami&copy; OpenLDAP image, HCL DX can focus on delivering enhanced features and support without the overhead of maintaining its customized container. This shift is to provide you with more reliable and up-to-date solutions for your test environments. The new alternative, Bitnami&copy;, will be provided but will not ship with the release. Sample LDIF (LDAP data interchange format) files for your OpenLDAP configuration will also be available.
    
### Removal of automated Pod restart on ConfigMap updates

=== "Containers"
    Runtime Controller triggering Pod restarts for [direct configuration changes](../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/index.md#rollout-of-configuration-changes) in ConfigMaps is removed. You must restart the appropriate Pods manually to apply the changes made to the ConfigMaps for testing configurations. For more information, see [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md).
