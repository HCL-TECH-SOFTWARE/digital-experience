### Automatically apply 9.5 from a later CF installation

=== "On-Premises"
    In CF219, a feature was introduced where [DX version 9.5 is automatically applied](../../deployment/install/traditional/cf_install/index.md) to an 8.5 or 9.0 installation if the configuration setting `install_95=true` is set. Note that a later CF might apply 9.5 by default unless you set `install_95=false`. This statement is not a guarantee of future releases or their features.

## Digital Experience 9.5 Container Version

### Notice of deprecation of non-OCI-based registry for Harbor Helm chart repository

### Removal of automated Pod restart on ConfigMap updates

You must restart the appropriate Pods manually to apply the changes made to the ConfigMaps for testing configurations. For more information, see [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md).
