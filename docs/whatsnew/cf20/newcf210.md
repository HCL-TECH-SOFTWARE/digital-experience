## Digital Experience 9.5 Container Version

### ATTENTION: Updated default resource requests and limits for Kubernetes deployments

=== "Containers"
    The minimal system requirements for Kubernetes deployments have been updated. See the [Containerization requirements and limitations](../../get_started/plan_deployment/container_deployment/limitations_requirements.md) for more information.

    The minimal system requirements are now the default settings in the HCL DX's helm charts' `values.yaml`.

    If you have not overwritten the resource configuration in your `custom-values.yaml`, verify the updated settings to ensure they still fit your purpose. 
    
    If you relied on the default values in previous versions, check if the minimal system requirement settings still fit your deployment scenario. Ensure proper performance testing before rolling this change out.

    Feel free to update your `custom-values.yaml` with resource settings that fit your needs. You may also want to check the [default resource settings in previous releases](./newcf210-old-resources-detail.md).

=== "Containers"
    A new option is available to configure Web Content Manager services in the IBM WebSphere Administrative Console to use relative URLs for DAM references in WCM content during staging to production operations. See the topic [Staging DAM to rendering environments](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/staging_dam/dam_subscription_staging.md) for more information.


### Option to configure aspect ratios for cropping of images in DAM

=== "Containers"
    It is now possible to [define custom aspect rations for cropping](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/dam_crop_aspect_ratio.md) of images in DAM.   

### Design Studio Beta Update

    Effective with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF210, the Design Studio Beta has been removed. Future Digital Experience 9.5 releases will incorporate feedback on the features received during the Beta evaluation period. See the Help Center topic [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md) for more information.

    As a result of the removal of Design Studio Beta (software) from the release, the following [Web Content Manager APIs](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/experience-api-documentation/wcm-api/#tag/Content/paths/~1contents/get) related to that software are removed:
