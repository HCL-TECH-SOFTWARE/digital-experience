=== "On-Premises"
    The `User Session Reporting Tool` is a utility designed for HCL Digital Experience (DX) users, initialy for those managing `on-premise deployments`. This tool provides a robust solution for analyzing and interpreting web traffic data by processing `NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) access log files` by extracting the relevant parts of each log message to identify and count unique user sessions, offering a clear and precise understanding of usage data over specified periods.
