# Integrating HCL Leap with HCL Digital Experience

HCL Leap builds dynamic forms and applications with a web-based interface. From a single interface, you can design a form, define access privileges, create workflow stages, deploy the application, and review submitted results. For more information, see the [HCL Leap documentation](https://help.hcltechsw.com/Leap/welcome/index.html).

!!! note
    - This guide only applies to HCL Digital Experience (DX) 9.5 Container Deployments in combination with HCL Leap Helm installations.
        The currently supported version combination is:
        - HCL Digital Experience CF213 and later versions
        - HCL Leap 9.3.2
    - The specified Leap version is the tested version. Using later versions will most probably work but it is not guaranteed.
