# Installing HCL Leap to integrate with HCL Digital Experience

HCL Digital Experience (DX) can be integrated with HCL Leap. Both products can be installed in the same Kubernetes cluster using the same Kubernetes namespace. Common parts of the deployments can be reused which is described [in the Configuration section](../configuration/index.md).

## Deploy HCL Digital Experience using Helm

For the deployment and installation of DX, refer to [Deploy Container Platforms Using Helm](../../../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/overview.md). This integration guide assumes that DX is deployed and configured successfully.

## Deploy HCL Leap using Helm

1. Update the custom values file to set Leap image name, tags, and repository name. The procedure is similar to the instructions in the topic [Prepare Configuration page for DX](../../../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/mandatory_tasks/prepare_configuration/). The value options for Leap are documented [in the Leap documentation](https://help.hcltechsw.com/Leap/9.3.2/deploy_container_kubernetes_openliberty.html).

2. Deploy HCL Leap. For more information, refer to the [Deploying to a Container (Kubernetes) Platform - Open Liberty](https://help.hcltechsw.com/Leap/9.3.2/deploy_container_kubernetes_openliberty.html) section of the HCL Leap product documentation.

!!!note "Post-deployment tasks"
    You should now be able to access Leap through `https://<your-domain>/apps`. It is recommended that you perform the [post-deployment tasks](https://help.hcltechsw.com/Leap/9.3.2/in_setting_up_environment.html) for HCL Leap.
