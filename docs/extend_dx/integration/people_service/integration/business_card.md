# Business Card component

The default Business Card web component in People Service provides a concise and informative snapshot of a user's profile. It displays essential information such as the user’s image or avatar, name, role, organization, email address, and phone number. This digital business card replaces the existing Person Card component and serves as a quick reference to facilitate communication and connection within the organization. 

Business Cards appear when users hover over names such as the author of a blog entry or a user’s comment on a post. It allows users to view other user profiles or contact another person directly.

## Building custom Business Cards

If the pre-built UI components do not cover your specific needs, the robust set of APIs from People Service offers a flexible alternative. These APIs allow you to create custom user experiences that mirror the functionality of native services while adhering to the unique design and interaction requirements.
