# Business card component

## Default web component

The default Business Card web component in People Service replaces the existing Person Card component. It provides a concise and informative snapshot of a user's profile, displaying essential information such as the user’s image or avatar, name, role, organization, email address, and phone number. This digital business card serves as a quick reference to facilitate communication and connection within the organization.

Designed to enhance user interaction, the Business Card appears when users hover over names, such as the author of a blog entry or a user’s comment on a post. It includes interactive actions like contacting the person directly or viewing their full user profile.

## Building custom business card

If the pre-built UI components does not cover your specific needs, the robust set of APIs from the People Service offers a flexible alternative. These APIs allow you to custom-create user experiences that mirror the functionality of native services while adhering to the unique design and interaction requirements.

Please refer to [API documentation](../api) for more information.
