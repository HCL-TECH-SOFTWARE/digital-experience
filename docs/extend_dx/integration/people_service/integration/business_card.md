# Business card component

## Default web component

The default Business Card web component within People Service will replace existing Person Card component, that will provide a concise and informative snapshot of a user's profile. This digital business card displays essential information such as the user’s image or avatar, name, role, organization, email address, and phone number. It serves as a quick reference to facilitate communication and connection within the organization.

It is designed to enhance user interaction, the business card appears when users hover over names, such as the author of a blog entry or a user’s comment on a post. It includes interactive actions like contacting the person directly or viewing their full user profile.

## Building custom business card

If the pre-built UI components does not cover your specific needs, the robust set of APIs from the people service offers a flexible alternative. These APIs allow for the custom creation of user experiences that mirror the functionality of native services while adhering to unique design and interaction requirements.

Please refer to [API documentation](../api) for more information.
