# HCL People Service

HCL People Service enriches HCL Digital Experience (DX) by adding a layer of social connectivity by helping team members to connect, especially in large projects. It enhances user profiles with additional data and interactive features, improving team collaboration and project execution.

People Service is integrated with corporate user directories, allowing existing user bases to be included. It offers a flexible user interface that displays information through user profiles, business cards, and more. You can personalize People Service profiles with additional attributes, images, and tags for skills and interest.

Within the DX environment, authored content is linked to the actual users, adding interactivity through pop-up business cards and profile links. The service is also supported by a robust API layer compatible with OpenAPI, ensuring third-party support and extensibility.
