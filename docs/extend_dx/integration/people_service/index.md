# HCL People Service

HCL People Service enriches HCL Digital Experience (DX) by adding a layer of social connectivity, making it easier for team members to discover and engage with each other, especially in large projects. It enhances user profiles with additional data and interactive features, improving team collaboration and project execution between skilled professionals.

People Service is integrated with corporate user directories, allowing existing user bases to be included seamlessly. It offers a flexible user interface that displays information through user profiles, business cards, and more. People Service profiles can be personalized with additional attributes, images, and tags for skills and interest, making it easier for colleagues to connect.

Within the DX environment, authored content is linked to the actual users, adding interactivity through pop-up business cards and profile links. The service is also supported by a robust API layer compatible with OpenAPI, ensuring third-party support and extensibility.
