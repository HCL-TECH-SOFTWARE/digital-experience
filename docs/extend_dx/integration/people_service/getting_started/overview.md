# Overview

In any digital workplace, the role of people is central. Interactions often occur between individuals or between people and content, which is typically personalized and authored.

The people service enriches the HCL Digital Experience (DX) by adding a layer of social connectivity, making it easier for team members, especially in large projects, to discover and engage with each other. By enhancing user profiles with additional data and interactive features, it facilitates easier discovery and connection of skilled professionals, thereby enhancing team collaboration and project execution.

The People Service enhances DX by integrating with corporate user directories, allowing existing user bases to be seamlessly included. It offers a flexible user interface that displays information through user profiles, business cards, and more. People Service profiles can be personalized with additional attributes, upload images, and tag skills or interests, fostering easier connections among colleagues.

Furthermore, the service is supported by a robust API layer compatible with OpenAPI, ensuring third-party support and extensibility. Within the DX environment, it links authored content to the actual users, adding interactivity through popup business cards and profile links.

Deployment is streamlined through existing DX helm charts, maintaining consistency in administration and troubleshooting across the platform. This integration ensures a unified approach to managing both content and user interactions within the digital experience framework.
