# API documentation

Explore the API documentation section of the people service, which provides an overview of the available APIs and how to interact with them. This section serves as a reference for developers and administrators looking to leverage the people service APIs to enhance their platforms. It includes details on the available APIs, including references to OpenAPI and Swagger Explorer, to help users understand and work with the people service APIs effectively.

## Working with APIs

The people service APIs are designed to provide developers and administrators with the necessary tools to interact with the service and enhance their platforms. The APIs are RESTful and follow standard conventions, making them easy to work with and integrate into existing systems. The following sections provide an overview of the available APIs and how to interact with them effectively.

The people service APIs are categorized into the following sections:

- Authentication: APIs related to user authentication and session management.
- Profiles: APIs related to managing user profiles, including creating, updating, and deleting profiles.
- Schema: APIs related to managing profile attributes and schema definitions.
- Custom fields: APIs related to managing custom fields for user profiles.
- Images and media: APIs related to managing profile images and media content.
- Tags: APIs related to managing tags for user profiles.
- Search: APIs related to searching for user profiles based on specific criteria.
- Privacy: APIs related to managing user privacy settings and data protection.
- Federation and user directories: APIs related to integrating with external user directories and federated identity providers.
- Utils: Utility APIs for common tasks and operations.
- Probes: Health check APIs for monitoring the service status and availability.

## OpenAPI and Swagger Explorer

The people service APIs are documented using OpenAPI, which provides a standard way to describe RESTful APIs and generate interactive documentation. The OpenAPI specification is available for each API category, allowing developers and administrators to explore the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

To check out the OpenAPI documentation for the people service APIs, use the Swagger Explorer tool. The Swagger Explorer provides an interactive interface for exploring the APIs, making it easy to understand the available endpoints and test them with sample requests.

You can access the Swagger Explorer for the people service APIs via the URL &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/dx/api/people/v1/explorer and the OpenAPI specification via the URL &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/dx/api/people/v1/openapi/openapi.json

## OpenAPI Specification

See the [OpenAPI spec](https://pages.git.cwp.pnp-hcl.com/Team-Q/internal-doc/enable/b2e-services/people-service/api-documentation/people-service-openapi-spec.json) for more details on the people service API schema.
