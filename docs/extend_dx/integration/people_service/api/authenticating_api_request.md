# Authenticating API requests

The people service APIs require authentication for most requests to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify user data. This section provides details on how to ensure secure communication with the people service APIs by authenticating your API requests.

For more information about authentication in general, refer to the [authentication](../administration/authentication/index.md) section. The important details are that the people service uses OIDC for authentication and requires a valid authorization token to authorize API requests. The authorization token is generated by the people service after successful authentication against the configured identity provider.

As OIDC focuses on browser-based Single Sign-On (SSO) flows, the APIs can only be used after a user has authenticated via the browser. The people service then issues an access token that can be used to authenticate API requests. The access token is passed in the Authorization header of the API request.

As the JWT token secret and expiration are configurable, valid tokens could be generated with alternate providers. For this purpose, the people service provides the API endpoint `dx/api/people/v1/auth/token` to provide a valid token for API requests. If the token is valid, it will be provided to the user's browser session for use in subsequent API requests.
