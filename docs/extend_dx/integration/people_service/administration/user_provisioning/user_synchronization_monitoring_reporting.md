# User synchronization monitoring and reporting

## Overview

The user synchronization process ensures that your organization's user records remain consistent across multiple systems by integrating data from various directories, consolidating it, and updating the internal repository. The synchronization job handles the fetching, consolidation, and processing of user data to maintain up-to-date records.

Monitoring and reporting are critical to understanding how the synchronization job performs, identifying potential issues, and ensuring that user data is synchronized correctly across all systems. This document outlines key steps in monitoring and interpreting the logs generated during the synchronization process.

### Monitoring Summary

- **Fetching Users**: Logs are generated to track the start, any errors encountered, and the successful completion of the user data retrieval process from various directories.
- **Consolidating Users**: Logs are used to monitor the process of merging and consolidating user data. These logs capture the start of the consolidation process, any errors that occur, and confirmation of successful completion.

## Important Log Messages

Monitoring log messages during the synchronization process is crucial for identifying issues and ensuring successful synchronization. Here are some key log messages to pay attention to:

1. **Start and Completion Logs:**
    - **Starting synchronization:** Indicates the beginning of the process.
    - **Synchronization completed successfully:** Confirms that the process finished without major issues.

2. **Error Logs:**
    - **Pipeline failed:** Indicates a critical failure in the streaming pipeline.
    - **Error fetching users from database:** Flags issues with retrieving data from the local repository.
    - **Error processing user with id [GUID]:** Points to problems during individual user processing.

3. **Data Integrity Logs:**
    - **Deleted profile image for user with id [GUID]:** Confirms that associated assets are being correctly managed.
    - **Deleted user with id [GUID]:** Ensures that stale user data is correctly removed.

4. **Performance and Metrics Logs:**
    - **Time lapsed for synchronization:** Provides insight into the duration of the process, which can be useful for performance tuning.
