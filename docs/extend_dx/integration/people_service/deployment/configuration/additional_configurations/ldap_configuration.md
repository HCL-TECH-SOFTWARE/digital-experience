# LDAP configuration

LDAP allows the People Service to integrate with an external directory service, typically used in large organizations, to manage and retrieve user information. This integration provides centralized access to user profiles and related data, such as email, phone number, and organizational structure, directly from the LDAP directory. While the People Service can function without LDAP, enabling LDAP adds significant advantages, such as centralized user management, consistent user profiles across systems, and access to additional user-related data without the need for duplication.

!!! note
    Please ensure that the base DN is configured to match the configuration for DX.

To set up People Service with LDAP for user federation, see the [Configuration - LDAP](../index.md#ldap-configuration) documentation.
