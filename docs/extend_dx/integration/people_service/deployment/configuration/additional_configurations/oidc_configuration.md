# OIDC configuration

OpenID Connect (OIDC), an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OIDC allows clients to verify the identity of end-users based on authentication performed by an authorization server and to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

When integrating People Service with other products or services, OIDC provides a standardized way to authenticate users and obtain user information. This ensures seamless user experiences across different applications and services, as well as secure and reliable authentication mechanisms.

To set up People Service with OIDC for authentication, see the [Configuration - OIDC configuration](../index.md#oidc-configuration) documentation.
