# The Blogs portlet

The IBM® Connections Blogs detail portlet gives you access to your blogs from within IBM WebSphere® Portal.

## Purpose

Use the Blogs portlets to interact with the IBM Connections Blogs feature so you can read or contribute to blogs without leaving the IBM WebSphere Portal environment. You can also view and contribute to Ideation Blogs you can access. Ideation blogs, unlike standard blogs, are used to generate and promote ideas in a community.

-   If the Blogs portlet is deployed on a community page, Ideation blogs can display in the portlet if the **Show Ideation blog in this community** option is checked on the Edit shared settings.

    !!! note
        The option to show ideation blogs is not available as a setting if the Blogs portlet is on a stand-alone page or if there is no Ideation blog in the associated community.

-   If the Blogs portlet is deployed on a stand-alone page, and you are in the My Blogs view, you can click a blog to see the entries but you cannot click entries created by other users. To enter comments, vote for an idea, or recommend an entry, open Blogs in the web application.
-   Pin options in the Blogs Edit Shared Settings mode are not available from the My Blogs view of the portlet. You can pin the Blogs portlet only from the public views (Latest Entries and All Blogs.)

The Blogs Detail portlet has three views, **Latest Entries**, **All Blogs**, and **My Blogs**.

The **Latest Entries** view displays recent entries and comments posted to blogs. From this view, you can:

-   Click an entry to read it. If comments are enabled, you can add a comment.
-   Click an idea to read it or vote on it.
-   Click the name of a contributor to view the associated business card.
-   Sort the view by **Date**, **Title**, **Likes/Votes**, **Comments**, or **Visits**.

The **All Blogs** view lists all blogs for your organization. From this view, you can:

-   Click the name of a blog to open it and view the entries.
-   Click the name of an Ideation Blog to open it so that you can view the ideas and view voting activity.
-   Vote on an idea.
-   Click **More** to view details for the blog, such as a description or tags.
-   Click the name of a blog owner to view the associated business card.

The **My Blogs** view lists blogs for which you are an owner or member. From this view, you can:

-   Click the name of a blog to open it. You can view the entries and comments or create an entry.
-   Click the name of an Ideation Blog to open it so that you can view the ideas and view voting activity.
-   Click **Settings** to edit the basics for a blog, including the title, description, and tags. You can also add blog owners, authors, or draft users.
-   Click **Start a Blog** to start a new blog.

    !!! note
        You cannot create an Ideation Blog from the Blogs portlet because it must be created within a community.


!!!tip
    If your site has a large number of blogs, use the Tags portlet to find blogs that interest you. You can also edit a blog and then access it by sorting by recently updated blogs.
