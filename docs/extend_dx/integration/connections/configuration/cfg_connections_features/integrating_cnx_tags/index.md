# Integrating HCL Connections tags

You can integrate tags from HCL Connections into the HCL Digital Experience tag cloud. The HCL Connections portlets are required to get full function.

HCL Connections tags are available in theHCL Portal tag cloud after the scheduled task runs to retrieve tags from the HCL Connections server.

-   **[Configure authentication](../collab/i_coll_t_enable_lctags_auth.md)**  
Portal requests data from the HCL Connections server through the HCL Connections search API. By default, access to public data is not secured. In case security is enabled for that application, authentication is required. You can use on of the following authentication methods: basic authentication and LTPA forwarding.
-   **[Configuring task to retrieve tags](../collab/i_coll_t_enable_lctags_task.md)**  
When you integrate HCL Connections with your portal server, the portal uses a task to retrieve tags and related resources from the various HCL Connections features \(such as activities, blogs, bookmarks, communities, files, forums, profiles, and wikis\). Then, the portal integrates the tags in the portal tag cloud. You can schedule the task to retrieve the tags to run periodically.
