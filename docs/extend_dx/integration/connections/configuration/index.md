The signer certificate that is used by the HCL Connections server must be trusted by the portal server. The instructions for deploying the HCL Connections portlets include a procedure to import the SSL certificate. If you did not complete that procedure, you must import the certificate to use community pages. For best results, follow the procedures that are provided in the HCL Connections documentation.
