# Configuring community pages

Configure how you want community pages access to work in your portal site. For example you can configure community pages to automatically grant access to the page, how many child pages affected by community associations, and more.

Procedures in this section are not required. Complete only the configuration procedures that you need.

<!--
-   **[Automatically grant page access to community members](../admin-system/commpages_delegate_access.md)**  
If you want community members to automatically be able to access the page, without explicitly configuring access, you must enable that feature. Community membership must be integrated with portal security before you can enable this feature.
-   **[Overriding access control integration during community page instantiation](../admin-system/commpages_create_mapping_overac.md)**  
The Restrict view access to this page to community members setting on a community page automatically grants access to the page to members of the associated community. When specified on a page template, the setting is also applied to any pages that are created from the template. However, you can override this setting on a page template by defining a page parameter.
-   **[Configure limits for propagation of community associations](../admin-system/commpages_limitpropagation.md)**  
You can control how many nested child pages that are affected by community associations and changed community associations.
-   **[Configuring the number of retrieved communities](../admin-system/commpages_picker_size.md)**  
You can define how many communities are retrieved from the HCL Connections server when searching for communities in the Page Associations window. -->
