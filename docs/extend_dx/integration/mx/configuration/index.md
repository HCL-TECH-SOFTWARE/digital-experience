# Configuring HCL Volt MX Foundry for integration with HCL Digital Experience

## Configuring Ingress for HCL Digital Experience and HCL Volt MX Foundry

As a pre-requisite, DX needs to be installed already. Use the below link to install DX and configure ingress for DX

[Install DX](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/digital-experience/CF220/deployment/)

You can use an [optional Ingress](../../../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/optional_tasks/optional-configure-ingress.md) with HCL Digital Experience. While an Ingress is not required to run HCL Digital Experience, it can be configured to be reused by HCL Volt MX Foundry to handle the routing for both products and make them available on the same host.

1. Set up the Ingress for HCL Digital Experience. For more information, refer to the [optional Ingress documentation](../../../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/optional_tasks/optional-configure-ingress.md).
2. Configure HCL Volt MX Foundry to use the existing Ingress controller. The following sample values for HCL Volt MX Foundry configure the Ingress to use an SSL connection using the provided custom certificates. 
     - The certificate in `customCert` must match the certificate used for the Ingress configuration of HCL Digital Experience. The `cer` and `key` file must be located in the `apps/certs` directory of the MX Helm chart.
     - The `class` in this configuration refers to the class name of the deployed Ingress controller.
     - The `serverDomainName` must match the hostname that the Ingress is available at:
    
         ```yaml
         ingress:
           enabled: true
           protocol: "https"
           port: "443"
           class: "nginx"
           tls:
             enabled: true
             customCert:
               cert: "certs/your-ssl-cert.cer"
               key: "certs/your-ssl-cert.key"
         serverDomainName: "your-mx-and-dx-host.com"
         ```
         
     Refer to the [HCL Volt MX Foundry Configuration documentation](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_containers_helm/Content/Installing_Containers_With_Helm.html#configuration) for more details on the used values.


!!! important
    Please verify DX connect before installing MX Foundry. Open link like protocol://your-mx-and-dx-host.com/hcl/dxconnect/processHandler/version

    Once all services and pods are up and running, the MX Foundry can be accessed by following url like below:-

    protocol://your-mx-and-dx-host.com/mfconsole
     
After applying the configuration, both HCL Digital Experience and HCL Volt MX Foundry can be accessed using the provided hostname.
