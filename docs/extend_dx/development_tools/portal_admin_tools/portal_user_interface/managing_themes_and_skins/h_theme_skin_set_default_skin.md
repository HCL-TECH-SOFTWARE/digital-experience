title: Setting the default skin

Select a skin that is used as the default for all portlets across the portal.

To set a portal-wide default skin for portlets:

1.  Select a skin from the skins list.

2.  Click **Set as default portal skin**.


If no default skin is set for a theme, the portal default skin is used. You should not apply the skin with the name NoSkin to a portlet. This skin is intended for administrative portlets and renders the portlet without a title bar.
