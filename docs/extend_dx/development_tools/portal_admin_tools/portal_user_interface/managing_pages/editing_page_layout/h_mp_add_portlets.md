title: Adding a portlet to a page
---




Portlets are added to the page by submitting a search and then selecting from the list of available portlets. Only portlets available in the portlet list can be placed on the selected page. After you place a portlet in a row or column, you cannot modify the row or column without removing all portlets from that outlined container.

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface** \> **Manage Pages**.

2.  Go to the page where you want to add a portlet.

3.  Click the **Edit Page Layout** icon for the page.

4.  Click **Add Portlets**.

5.  In the list of available portlets, click the box next to the portlet title to select the portlet, then click **OK**.

    If the list of portlets is long, you can also search for a portlet title. You can select more than one portlet to add to the page.

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  Click **Done** to save the modified page.
