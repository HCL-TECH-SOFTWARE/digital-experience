# Configuration Wizard



You installed your HCL Digital Experience software. Now let the Configuration Wizard guide you through configuring your system. To begin, select a configuration option and provide basic input about your environment. Based on this information, the Configuration Wizard provides you with examples, recommended values, customized instructions, and scripts that you can run.

## Steps for configuring your target system with the selected configuration option

The Configuration Wizard uses a three-step process to customize the selected configuration option to your environment.

After you install your HCL Digital Experience software, use the Configuration Wizard guide to configure your system. To begin, select a configuration option and provide basic information about your environment. Based on your input, the Configuration Wizard provides examples, values, customized instructions, and scripts.

1. Answer Questions

Answer questions about your environment, configuration goals, and preferences. The selections and input that you enter in this step determine the parameters and properties that you review in the next step. The Configuration Wizard also uses your values to provide relevant examples for your configuration.

**Warning:** Do not use the browser navigation buttons to move between tabs on the **Answer Questions** page.

2. Customize Values

The Configuration Wizard initially displays the minimum number of fields that are required for this configuration for you to review and provide input. For a more advanced configuration, click **Advanced** to see fields that might apply to your configuration.

Default values are provided where possible, along with example values, to provide a more guided configuration experience. Click the pop-up help by the field name to see a description and other information to help you select the best value for your configuration goal.

The Configuration Wizard uses your values to create customized property \(helper\) files in the next step. Only syntax validation is provided for the values that you enter in the fields. For example, if you enter a URL value, the Configuration Wizard cannot validate that this URL exists. Instead, the Configuration Wizard validates that the URL has the correct format for a URL value.

**Warning:** Do not use the browser navigation buttons to move between tabs on the **Customize Values** page or to go back to the **Answer Questions** page.

3. Configure

You are ready to configure your system. You can run the configuration now or save files to run on another system.
