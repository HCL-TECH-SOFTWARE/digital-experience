# Sample Pipelines for use with HCL DXClient and Automation servers

A CI/CD pipeline can help automate processes in the development and test cycle, including deploying code to test and production environments. HCL DX 9.5 provides sample pipelines for use with the DXClient tooling to demonstrate how the deployment of portlets, Script Applications, Themes, DX Application, export and import of WCM libraries, etc., can be automated.

!!! note 
    The sample pipelines referred in this topic are supported only until the HCL Digital Experience Container update version CF195. We recommend that you refer to the following sample pipelines for releases CF196 and later.

    - [Sample Pipelines for the DXClient Docker image file](sample_pipelines_docker_dxclient.md)
    
    - [Sample Pipelines for the DXClient node package file](sample_pipelines_node_dxclient.md)

## Sample Pipeline details

Sample Pipelines are provided for deploying or updating a portlet application, Script Application, or Themes. The sample pipelines are made available under the samples folder in the DXClient root folder. Developers and administrators can use these pipelines as a basis for Jenkins automation server jobs.
