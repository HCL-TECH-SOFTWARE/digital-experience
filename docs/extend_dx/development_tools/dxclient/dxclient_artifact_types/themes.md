# Themes Artifacts

This topic provides information about the deployment and undeployment of themes artifacts.

## Deploy theme

The `deploy-theme` command is used to deploy a theme (EAR and WebDAV based) from a source client or server environment to a target HCL DX 9.5 CF192 or later server using the provided theme registration XML file, deployable EAR file, and WebDAV theme collection.

-   **Required files**

    Theme Registration XML file: This XML file is required to register the theme into DX Server.

    Theme deployable EAR file: This EAR file containing theme data is used for deploying into the WebSphere Application Server.

    WebDAV theme collection: The theme collection folder/zip is used to create or update the collection in WebDAV file store of the DX Server.

    !!! note
        This command can execute below one or more tasks together:

        1.  Theme Registration
        2.  Theme EAR deployment
        3.  WebDAV theme collection

-   **Command**

    ```
    dxclient deploy-theme -xmlFile <path> -applicationFile <path> -applicationName <application name> 
    -themeName <theme collection name> -themePath <folder/zip path of theme collection>
    ```

    !!! note

        -   For new WebDAV theme collection, DXClient tool adds the provided collection (folder/zip) to the WebDAV file store.
        -   For existing WebDAV theme collection, the existing theme collection is replaced by the provided theme collection during the update. To get the latest theme collection from the DX server, see [Exporting content from the filestore](../../../../build_sites/themes_skins/developing_theme/dev_op_overview/manual_packaging_themes/themeopt_move_expfilestore.md) and make modifications on the same folder to get it updated in the DX Server WebDAV file store.
        -   For the WebDAV theme collection update, a backup of the existing theme collection is taken and placed in the `store/outputFiles/themes/backup/foldername` folder in case it is required to revert back to the update.
        Log files from command execution can be found in the logs directory of the DXClient installation.

    !!! example

        ```
        dxclient deploy-theme -dxProtocol <http/https> -hostname <host-name> -dxPort <dxPort> -xmlConfigPath <xmlConfigPath> -dxUsername <dxUsername> -dxPassword <dxPassword> -dxSoapPort <dxSoapPort> -hostname <hostname> -dxConnectPort <dxConnectPort> -dxConnectUsername <dxConnectUsername> -dxConnectPassword <dxConnectPassword> -xmlFile <xml-file-with-path> -applicationFile <application-file-with-path> -applicationName <application name> -themeName <theme-name> -themePath <theme-path> -dxProfileName <Profile name of the DX core server> 
        ```


## Undeploy theme

The undeploy-theme command can be used to undeploy a theme, including the EAR application and WebDAV files, and it also unregisters the registered theme from the target DX server.

!!! note
    If enableBackup is set to true, then undeploy-theme takes a backup of the deployed EAR theme, WebDAV theme collection, and completes DX configuration export (without users) and place it in the backup folder. When the user is downloading EAR, WeDAV, and XML to backup, we must separate it by the folder names `store/outputFiles/themes/backup/foldername`.

The backup of EAR is placed in `store/outputFiles/themes/backup/application`.

Users can restore the theme by using the backup files.

!!! note 
    Pages might lose the applied theme references in the restored themes.

-   **Command description**

    This command invokes the undeploy-theme tool inside the DXClient.

    This command uses the unregistered theme XML file, theme EAR application name and WebDAV theme collection name, and executes the undeploy theme task.

    ```
    dxclient undeploy-theme
    
    ```

-   **Help command**

    This command shows the help document on the `undeploy-theme` command usage:

    ```
    dxclient undeploy-theme -h
    ```

-   **Required files**

    Theme Unregistration XML file: This XML file is required to unregister the theme from target DX Server and must contain the details of the theme. The XML file must be provided when executing the undeploy theme task.

    This command can execute one or more of the following tasks at the same time:

    -   Theme unregistration
    -   Undeploy theme EAR application
    -   Undeploy WebDAV theme collection
