# DXClient

DXClient is a command line tool featuring a single, unified interface to all HCL DX automation and CI/CD-related tasks. It helps developers manage several DX tasks such as uploading one or more portlets, Script Applications, and themes. Administrators can manage WCM libraries, PZN rules, shared libraries, etc. 

DXClient can take artifacts developed locally and deploy them to HCL DX servers independently of whether these are deployed on-premises platforms in standalone, cluster, or farm-topologies, or in a container environment.

DXClient is meant to be the one-stop, platform-independent solution that lets you integrate HCL DX with any automation infrastructure of your choice.

DXClient comes with two deployment options:

- First option is to deploy using the DXClient container package. DXClient is packaged as a container that you can run using OCI-based runtimes such as Docker or Podman. It is available as a container image from HCL DX 9.5 CF196 and later releases. For more information, see [DXClient installation using container package](#installing-dxclient-using-the-container-package-from-hcl-software-portal).

- The alternative option is to deploy DXClient as native JavaScript code. Users who want to use this deployment option must install their own Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm) runtime environment in the correct version. Users must also install the required dependencies. For more information, see [DXClient installation using native js package](#installing-dxclient-using-the-native-javascript-package-from-hcl-software-portal).

!!!important "Information about DXClient versions and distribution"
    DXClient is now free to download and install through [NpmJS and Harbor repositories](#public-and-free-dxclient-installation-options). After openly distributing DXClient, the versioning format of DXClient is now changed from 1.xx.x to <CFNumber\>.x.x. For example, the version of DXClient in the previous release was "1.29.0". Starting CF221, the versioning format uses the corresponding CF number of the DX deployment, making the DXClient version for CF221 "221.0.0". 

    HCL DX also introduces a license agreement which can be accepted using the command `accept-license`. For command details, see [DXClient information commands](#dxclient-information-commands).

## Architecture

The following image illustrates the DXClient Architecture diagram:

![HCL DXclient Architecture diagram](../../../images/HCLDXClient_Architecture_Diagram.png)

## Installing DXClient using the container package from HCL Software portal

The container package provides a fully packaged OCI-compliant container that contains everything to successfully run DXClient. You may use any container runtime that implements OCI Runtime Specification (for example, Docker or Podman).

In addition, the package includes scripts for all operating systems that make it simpler to work with the container image. These scripts handle the storage for the container and sync input files with the container itself.

!!!note
    When you upgrade to use the container image DXClient, you must first uninstall the Node.js DXClient.

1. Navigate to the `<working-directory>` folder where you wish to use the DXClient from.

2. Download the DXClient.zip file (DXClient_VX_XXXXXXXX-XXXX.zip) to a local directory on the local workstation from your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF196 or higher entitlements on the HCL Software License Portal.

    !!! note
        If you are upgrading from the node to container image version of DXClient, you must first uninstall or unlink the current version using the following command before installing the newer version.

        === "Linux and Apple macOS"
            ```bash
            make unlink
            ```
            
        === "Microsoft Windows"
            ```bash
            make_unlink.bat
            ```

3. Extract the DXClient.zip file.

    !!! note
        The default OCI runtime for DXClient is docker. If you wish to use any other OCI runtime, run the following command before proceeding further.

        === "Linux and Apple macOS"
            ```bash
            export CONTAINER_RUNTIME=<YOUR_CONTAINER_RUNTIME>
                
            # For example: export CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman
            ```

        === "Microsoft Windows"
            ```batch
            set CONTAINER_RUNTIME=<YOUR_CONTAINER_RUNTIME>
                
            :: For example: set CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman
            ```

4. Load `dxclient.tar.gz` image.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        docker load < dxclient.tar.gz
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        ```batch
        docker load -i dxclient.tar.gz
        ```

5. Optional: Add DXClient to your PATH.
     Open terminal and add path to the DXClient bin directory to your PATH variable to be able to call DXClient from any directory. If you plan to run multiple versions of DXClient on the same system in parallel, you may want to skip this step.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        export PATH=<working-directory>/bin:$PATH
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        Open command prompt, add `dxclient.bat` script in the bin directory to the PATH variable, to call DXClient from any directory.

        ```batch
        set PATH=<working-directory>\bin;%PATH%
        ```

    !!! note
        You will lose these changes by closing the terminal/command prompt. If you set in system path permanently, kindly take the necessary steps to remove it.

6. Set appropriate read and execute permissions as per user/group/owner.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        chmod xxx <working-directory>/bin

        # where xxx is a 3-digit number where each digit can be anything from 0 to 7.
        # Ref: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_permissions_and_attributes#Numeric_method
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        1. Right click `<working-directory>/bin` directory > "Properties" > "Security" Tab.
        2. Set the appropriate permission for the folder.

7. Run `dxclient -V` to verify that the required version of DXClient command line is installed.

8. A folder named `store` will be created in your working directory. This is the shared volume location of your container. If you require to create a new volume directory for a different configuration, set the `VOLUME_DIR` to the desired directory name and run your task. For example:

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        export VOLUME_DIR=storeForScriptApplication

        # or if you want spaces in its value, enclosed it in double quotes ("")
        export VOLUME_DIR="store for script application"
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        ```batch
        set VOLUME_DIR=storeForScriptApplication

        :: or if you want spaces in its value
        set VOLUME_DIR=store for script application
        ```

        !!!warning
            Do not enclose the value of `VOLUME_DIR` in double quotes ("") in Windows. This will produce unwanted errors when executing dxclient commands.

     The `VOLUME_DIR` will require read and write access permissions. Set appropriate permissions for the `VOLUME_DIR` as per user/group/owner.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        chmod xxx <working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>

        # where xxx is a 3-digit number where each digit can be anything from 0 to 7.
        # Ref: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_permissions_and_attributes#Numeric_method
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        1. Right click `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>` directory > "Properties" > "Security" Tab.
        2. Set the appropriate permission for the folder.


9. You can find the configuration, logger, output, and sample files under location  `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>`.

    Common command arguments can be pre-configured inside the config.json file available under the `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>` folder. A sample configuration file that can be used on on-premises platforms in standalone, cluster (default-config.json) or kubernetes (default-config-kube.json) platforms is also available under <working-directory>/samples/sample-configurations for reference. If you want to override any of the parameters in the config.json, add them in your command line.

10. Refer to the sample pipeline provided to find out how to integrate the container image in the automation server.

11. By default, the logs will be available in UTC format. If needed, synchronize your local timezone from host to container using an environment variable as shown in the example below.

    Example usage:
    
    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        export Timezone=Asia/Kolkata
        ```
    
    === "Microsoft Windows"
        ```batch
        SET Timezone=Asia/Kolkata
        ```

## Installing DXClient using the native JavaScript package from HCL Software portal

!!! note
    You are encouraged to use the DXClient container image package from CF196 onwards for easier installation.

1.  Complete the following steps to install the DXClient tool in your local development workstation or automation server.

    !!! note
        If you are upgrading from CF19, CF191, or later releases, you should first unlink the current version using the following command before installing the newer version.

        === "Linux and Apple macOS"
            ```bash
            make unlink
            ```

        === "Microsoft Windows"
            ```batch
            make_unlink.bat
            ```

2.  Ensure that Node.js version 12.18.3 or later version is installed to the local workstation. The DXClient tool is supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple macOS workstations and automation servers.

3.  Download the DXClient.zip file (DXClient_VX_XXXXXXXX-XXXX.zip) to a local directory on the local workstation from your DX 9.5 CF19 or later entitlements on the [HCL Software License Portal](https://www.hcltech.com/software/support/release).

4.  Extract the DXClient.zip file.

5.  From the extracted folder, run the following command.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        make install
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        ```bash
        make_install.bat
        ```

6.  Optional: Run the following command to link your application to the local npm module in your machine. Refer to the following Notes section before you proceed.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        make link
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        ```bash
        make_link.bat
        ```

    !!! note
        -   Avoid using this command when scripting deployments from an automation server (for example, in pipelines) as there is a chance of picking up the wrong dependencies during tool version upgrades.
        -   If the `link` command is not used (such as on automation servers), then use the following command to run the application:

        === "Linux and Apple macOS"
            ```bash
            ./bin/dxclient
            ```

        === "Microsoft Windows"
            ```bash
            node bin/dxclient
            ```

7. A folder named `store` is created in your working directory. This is the default location for configuration, logger, and output files. If you require to create a new configuration, set the environment variable `VOLUME_DIR` to the desired directory name and run your task. For example:

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        export VOLUME_DIR=storeForScriptApplication

        # or if you want spaces in its value, enclose it in double quotes ("")
        export VOLUME_DIR="store for script application"
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        ```batch
        set VOLUME_DIR=storeForScriptApplication

        :: or if you want spaces in its value
        set VOLUME_DIR=store for script application
        ```

        !!!important
            Do not enclose the value of `VOLUME_DIR` in double quotes ("") in Windows. This produces errors when executing DXClient commands.

     The `VOLUME_DIR` requires read and write access permissions. Set appropriate permissions for the `VOLUME_DIR` as per user/group/owner.

    === "Linux and Apple macOS"
        ```bash
        chmod xxx <working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>

        # where xxx is a 3-digit number where each digit can be anything from 0 to 7.
        # Ref: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_permissions_and_attributes#Numeric_method
        ```

    === "Microsoft Windows"
        1. Right click `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>` directory > "Properties" > "Security" Tab.
        2. Set the appropriate permission for the folder.

8. You can find the configuration, logger, and output files under `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>`.

    Common command arguments can be pre-configured inside the config.json file available under the `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>` folder. A sample configuration file that can be used on on-premises platforms in standalone, cluster (default-config.json), or Kubernetes (default-config-kube.json) platforms is also available under <working-directory>/samples/sample-configurations for reference. If you want to override any of the parameters in the config.json, add them in your command line.

## Public and free DXClient installation options 

The following options to install DXClient are available starting CF221. Both options are free to use.

- [Install DXClient from the NpmJS public registry.](#installing-or-uninstalling-dxclient-from-npmjs-registry)

- [Install DXClient from the container image in the public Harbor repository.](#installing-dxclient-using-the-container-image-in-the-harbor-repository)

### Installing or uninstalling DXClient from NpmJS registry
          
The option to install or uninstall from the NpmJS registry is only available starting CF221. The DXClient version installed must be 221.0.0.

- To install the latest version of DXClient, use the `npm install @hcl-software/dxclient` command. 

- To install DXClient globally, use the `npm install -g @hcl-software/dxclient` command. 

- To uninstall DXClient, use the `npm uninstall @hcl-software/dxclient` command.

### Installing DXClient using the container image in the Harbor repository

1. Pull the docker image from https://hclcr.io/harbor/projects/95/repositories/dxclient/artifacts-tab using the following command:

    ```
     docker pull hclcr.io/dx-public/dxclient:IMAGE_TAG
    ```

2. Download DXClient scripts.
    
    To download DXClient scripts, go to [dxclient-scripts](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dxclient-scripts) of the HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE GitHub repository. In this repository, you can find the installation and usage details, and the latest scripts for using the containerized version of DXClient which is openly distributed in [HCL DX Open Harbor](https://hclcr.io/harbor/projects/95/repositories/dxclient/artifacts-tab).

## Verifying your DXClient installation

Successful installation of the DXClient tool can be checked by using the "`dxclient -V`" command, which should show the version of the DXClient tool installed.

Once installed, commands can be executed using the DXClient tool to perform CI/CD actions on HCL DX 9.5 servers.

!!! important
    The DXClient version is mostly forward and backward compatible with the DX CF versions. However, in some cases, it might not work as expected if the CF versions are different. Make sure that the CF versions of both DXClient and DX Core are the same in your installation.
    You can use "`dxclient version-compat`" to check version compatibility between DX Core and DXClient.

## Additional information
    
1. The attribute `-dxConnectHostname` has been deprecated (since CF202) and removed (since CF210) and must be replaced with `-hostname` wherever necessary.
2. The attribute `-targetServerHostname`, `-targetServerPort`,`-targetServerUsername`,`-targetServerPassword` & `-targetServerProfileName` has been deprecated (since CF202) and removed (since CF210) and must be replaced with `-targetHostname`, `-targetDxConnectPort`,`-targetDxConnectUsername`,`-targetDxConnectPassword` & `-targetDxProfileName` respectively wherever necessary.
3. If deploying or importing huge CICD artifacts using DXClient to the Kubernetes environment, you might receive failure or request pending messages while you run the ceratin tasks. This might happen because of the connection getting closed by the load balancer due to timeout before the response is ready. In such situations, before re-triggering the request, we advise you to check your target server to verify if the artifact has been deployed/imported or the server is up, as the request was already triggered from the client-side. In cases of request pending you are expected to receive a `requestId` which you can use to check the status of response later. Find troubleshooting tips [here](troubleshooting_dxclient.md#troubleshooting-for-some-known-issues).
4. As of CF213, the property `DXCONNECT_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE_MB` in DXC_ConfigSettings Resource Environment Provider has been removed. Refer [DXC_ConfigSettings](dxconnect.md#resource-environment-provider-property-for-dxconnect) for more details.

## Configuring DXClient

Common command arguments can be pre-configured inside the `config.json` file available under dist/src/configuration folder. A sample configuration file that can be used on on-premises platforms in standalone, cluster (default-config.json), or kubernetes (default-config-kube.json) platforms is also available under <working-directory>/samples/sample-configurations for reference. If you want to override any of the parameters in the config.json, add them in your command line.

```json
{
    "name":"config.json",
    "desc":"The attributes in this file are used for configuration purpose and those must not be deleted.",
    "dxProtocol": "",
    "dxConnectProtocol": "https",

### Configuring multiple environments in DXClient

A folder named `store` is created in your working directory. This is the default location for configuration, logger, and output files. If you require to create a new configuration, set the environment variable VOLUME_DIR to the desired directory name and run your task. For example:

=== "Linux and Apple macOS"
    ```bash
    export VOLUME_DIR=storeForScriptApplication

    # or if you want spaces in its value, enclose it in double quotes ("")
    export VOLUME_DIR="store for script application"
    ```

=== "Microsoft Windows"
    ```batch
    set VOLUME_DIR=storeForScriptApplication

    :: or if you want spaces in its value
    set VOLUME_DIR=store for script application
    ```

    !!!important
        - Do not enclose the value of `VOLUME_DIR` in double quotes ("") in Windows. This produces errors when executing DXClient commands. 
        - Do not provide a path to set as `VOLUME_DIR`. Instead, provide a folder name.

The `VOLUME_DIR` requires read and write access permissions. Set appropriate permissions for the `VOLUME_DIR` as per user/group/owner.

=== "Linux and Apple macOS"
    ```bash
    chmod xxx <working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>

    # where xxx is a 3-digit number where each digit can be anything from 0 to 7.
    # Ref: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_permissions_and_attributes#Numeric_method
    ```

=== "Microsoft Windows"
    1. Right click `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>` directory > "Properties" > "Security" Tab.
    2. Set the appropriate permission for the folder.

You can find the configuration, logger, and output under `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>`.

Common command arguments can be pre-configured inside the config.json file available under the `<working-directory>/<VOLUME_DIR>` folder. A sample configuration file that can be used on on-premises platforms in standalone, cluster (default-config.json), or Kubernetes (default-config-kube.json) platforms is also available under `<working-directory>/samples/sample-configurations` for reference. If you want to override any of the parameters in the config.json, add them in your command line.  

!!!note
    You must create the config.json in each `<VOLUME_DIR>` folder to set up multiple configurations. Otherwise, the system picks up the configurations specified in the default config.json available under `dist/configuration` in node version.

## Limitations

- For hybrid deployments in which two different hostnames are used for the on-premises DX Core and Kubernetes DX Services, there are no options to enter both the hostnames. You must consider the DXClient function being used and enter the appropriate hostname. For example, for DAM tasks such as `manage-dam-staging`, you must enter the Kubernetes hostname. For DX Core tasks such as `deploy-portlet` you must enter the on-premises DX Core hostname.

- Starting CF217 (DXClient v1.26.0 and above), it is required to set full access to the bin folder to execute DXClient commands.

- Currently, the maximum input file size allowed in DXClient is 256 MB.
