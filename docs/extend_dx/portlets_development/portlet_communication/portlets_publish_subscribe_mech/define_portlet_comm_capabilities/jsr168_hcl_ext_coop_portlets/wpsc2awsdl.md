# WSDL reference for cooperative portlets

WSDL is often used in the context of web services, in order to define interfaces implemented by a web service. The elements in the WSDL used by click-to-action are described, along with extensions to the <binding\> element and the WSDL Extensions schema.

Usually, a SOAP binding is used to specify the concrete realization of the interface by a web service which supports the SOAP protocol. The following shows how Click-to-Action uses some of the elements in the WSDL document. The [extensions to the <binding\> element](wpsc2awsdl.md#extensions-to-the-binding-element) are described and the complete [schema for WSDL Extensions](wpsc2awsdl.md#wsdl-extension-schema) is provided.

-   <types\>

    For cooperative portlets, this declares the data type of the data to be transferred. The data type is declared using XML Schema Datatypes \(XSD, see the [XSD specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/)\). There may be multiple types defined in the document.

    The following shows a declaration for the TrackingIDType:

    ```
    
        <types>
          <xsd:simpleType name="TrackingIDType">
            <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string">
            </xsd:restriction>
          </xsd:simpleType>
        </types>
       
    ```

-   <message\>

    Input messages can contain only one part.

-   <operation\>

    Provides an abstract definition of a Click-to-Action operation. Note the restriction on input messages mentioned previously.

-   <portType\>

    Defines an abstract collection of operations. The operations must be defined in the document. One operation corresponds to each action on the Click-to-Action enabled portlet. Only actions that are to be enabled for Click-to-Action should be declared.

-   <binding\>

    The binding element is extended to associate portlet actions with operations. For each operation, the portlet action name must be provided. The portlet action name may be specified using the name attribute of the action tag in the binding section of the WSDL file. If it is omitted, the name attribute from the operation tag is used as the portlet action name.

    For each operation parameter, the action parameter name must be provided. The portlet parameter name may be specified using the name attribute of the parameter tag in the binding section of the WSDL file. If it is omitted, the name attribute of the part tag associated with the param tag is used as the portlet parameter name.

    Further, the boundTo attribute may be used to specify where the parameter will be bound. Choices are request-parameter, request-attribute, session-attribute, or action-attribute.

    The <binding\> element includes cooperative portlet extensions, which are described in [Extensions to the <binding\> element](wpsc2awsdl.md#extensions-to-the-binding-element).


If you are familiar with WSDL, you might notice that the service section \(enclosed by the <service\> element in WSDL\) is not used in the C2A action declaration file. This is because the file is associated with a specific portlet implementing the operations defined in the file through external means \(an entry in the portlet.xml file associated with the portlet\).

## Extensions to the <binding\> element

The <binding\> element has been extended to support cooperative portlets. Each extension element is prefixed with `portlet:`, which refers to the C2A namespace, `http://www.ibm.com/wps/c2a`. The `portlet:` prefix is used to identify the extension elements in this section, but a different name may be used for the prefix as long as it refers to the C2A namespace. See [WSDL Extension Schema](wpsc2awsdl.md#wsdl-extension-schema).

-   <portlet:binding\>

    This must be the first child element of the WSDL <binding\> element. Its presence identifies the section as a C2A binding extension for portlet action invocation. The element has the following attribute.

    -   style

        Deprecated. Specifying `style="struts"` indicates that Struts actions are being declared. Instead, you should use `type=struts` on the <portlet:action\> element for this purpose.

-   <portlet:action\>

    This must be the first child element of any WSDL <operation\> element in the binding section. It contains the following attributes:

    -   name

        the portlet action name. If this is omitted, the name of the associated operation element is used as the portlet action name.

    -   caption

        a short string about the action suitable for displaying in the portlet user interface. For translated captions, indicate in dotted format the name of the key in the resource bundles from which the caption is to be obtained.

    -   type

        Indicates one of the following values:

        -   default indicates a DefaultPortletAction object is used. This object is deprecated but still supported for migration purposes.
        -   simple indicates a simple portlet action String is used.
        -   struts indicates a Struts action is used.
        -   standard indicates a standard \(JSR\) portlet action is used.
        -   standard-struts indicates a struts action is used with a standard \(JSR\) portlet.
    -   actionNameParameter

        \(Standard only\) The name of the request parameter which will be used to supply the action name.

    -   description

        a text description of the action. For translated descriptions, indicate in dotted format the name of the key in the resource bundles from which the description is to be obtained.

    -   activeOnStartup

        Indicate either "true" or "false". If false, the action must be programmatically activated in each session. If true \(default\), the action is active as soon as the portlet is initialized.

    -   selectOnMultipleMatch

        In the case that multiple actions match based on the data type for the portlet, this attribute can be used to indicate which action to trigger. Multiple matching actions can occur when a user broadcasts an action on a source. If not specified, the default is false. In the case where no single action is set to true, the data is not delivered to the target.

        In the following example from `TrackingC2A.wsdl`, There are two actions declared: trackingDetails and routingDetails. selectOnMultipleMatch is used to indicate that the trackingDetails should be used in the case of a multiple match.

        ```xmp
        
        <binding name="TrackingBinding" type="tns:Tracking_Service">
           <portlet:binding/>
           <operation name="trackingDetails">
              <portlet:action caption="Tracking Details"
                       description="Get tracking details for specified tracking id"
                       selectOnMultipleMatch="true"/>
              <input>
                  <portlet:param name="trackingId" partname="trackingId"/>
              </input>
              <output>
                  <portlet:param name="customerName" partname="custName" 
                                 boundTo="session"/>
              </output>
           </operation>
           <operation name="routingDetails">
              <portlet:action caption="Routing Details"
                       description="Get routing details for specified tracking id"/>
              <input>
                  <portlet:param name="trackingId" partname="trackingId"/>
              </input>
           </operation>
        </binding>
        
        ```

-   <constant:param\>

    This is used to set the value returned by the getConstantParameters method of the action. Each constant parameter will be bound as a request parameter with the specified name and value when the action is invoked. More than one constant parameter can be specified.

    -   name

        the name of the parameter.

    -   value

        specifies the parameter value.

    The following shows an example for using the constant parameter.

    ```
    
    	  <portlet:constant-params>
            <portlet:constant-param name="defaultMonth" value="January"/>
          </portlet:constant-params> 
    
    ```

-   <portlet:param\>

    This must appear as a child element in the <input\> or <output\> subelements of the <operation\> element in the binding. It specifies the parameters consumed \(if enclosed in the <input\> element\) or produced \(if enclosed in the <output\> element\) by the portlet action. At present, we restrict the number of parameters consumed to at most one. The number of parameters produced can be any number. It has the following attributes:

    -   name

        the name of the parameter. If omitted, the name attribute value of the part element is used as the parameter name.

    -   partname

        refers to a part element of the input or output for the operation. It may be omitted if the input or output has a single part.

    -   boundTo

        specifies where the parameter value is bound. Currently, this attribute can specify one of the following values only:

        -   `request-parameter` : This specifies that the value is bound as a parameter in the PortletRequest object. This is the default value if the boundTo attribute is omitted. Note that for output parameters, a different value should usually be specified as the default PortletRequest implementation provided by HCL Portal does not allow parameters to be set during action processing.
        -   `request-attribute` : This specifies that the value is bound as an attribute in the PortletRequest object.
        -   `session` : This specifies that the value is bound to the PortletSession object.
        -   `action` : This specifies that the value is bound to a portlet action.
        -   `render-parameter:` \(JSR only\) This specifies that the value is bound as a render parameter in the ActionResponse \(output parameters only\).
    -   presentIfNullValue

        specifies is null values for the parameter are significant for the purposes of wired action invocation. Value can be either "true" or "false", with "false" being the default. If "true", the presence of the parameter will cause the wired action to be invoked even if the value of the parameter is null. If "false", the presence of the parameter will cause the wired action to be invoked only if the parameter value is not null. Can be specified for either input or output parameters \(i.e, the treatment of null parameter values can be controlled at either the source or the target\).
