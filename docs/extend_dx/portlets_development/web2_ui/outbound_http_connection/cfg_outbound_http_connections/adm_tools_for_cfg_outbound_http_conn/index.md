# Administration tools for configuring outbound HTTP connections

Portal system administrators can administer the outbound HTTP connection configuration in one of two ways: either by using configuration tasks, or by using the portal Model and Controller SPIs.

-   **[Configuring outbound HTTP connections by using configuration tasks](../adm_tools_for_cfg_outbound_http_conn/cfg_outbound_http_using_cfgtsk/index.md)**  
Programmers can create, read, update, or delete settings of the outbound HTTP connection by using the appropriate portal configuration engine tasks.
-   **[Configuring outbound HTTP connections by using the Model Controller SPI](../adm_tools_for_cfg_outbound_http_conn/cfg_outbound_http_using_modelcontroller_spi/index.md)**  
To query and administer the outbound HTTP connection, you can also use the model controller SPI.
