# Control Access to Script Applications

For a user or group of users that are not members of the `wpsadmins` group, who you wish to allow access to edit Script Applications and Script Application configuration, you can grant editor and reviewer access to those users for the Script Application Library and Script Applications Site Area. Users who push Script Applications must have these access roles.
