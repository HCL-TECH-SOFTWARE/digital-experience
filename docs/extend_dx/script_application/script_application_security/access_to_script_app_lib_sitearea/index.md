# Control Access to Script Applications

For a user or group of users that are not members of the `wpsadmins` group, who you wish to allow access to edit Script Applications and Script Application configuration, you can grant editor and reviewer access to those users for the Script Application Library and Script Applications Site Area. Users who push Script Applications must have these access roles.

-   **[Granting access to the Script Application Library](acc_lib)**  
You can grant editor and reviewer access to the Script Application Library to additional users or groups.
-   **[Granting access to the Script Applications Site Area](acc_site_area)**  
By default, members of the wpsadmins group are both Editors and Reviewers, but you can specify extra users or groups.
