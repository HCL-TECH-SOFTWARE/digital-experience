# Creating page component configurations automatically 

You create page component configurations automatically when you create a page from a Content Template Catalog page template or when you drop a pre-configured portlet onto the page.

The page component configuration is created in the current area, in the local "Components" area. It can be modified independently of any page component configuration.

When the same portlet is used multiple times on the same page, the name is modified with an increasing suffix to prevent name clashes. You might want to modify the name and title of the page component configurations to make the individual instances more easily identified. In the slideshow and carousel components, the name cannot have spaces. Note that the title appears in the portlet toolbar in edit mode.
