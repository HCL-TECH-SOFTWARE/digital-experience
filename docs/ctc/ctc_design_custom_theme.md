# Customizing the theme for Content Template sites 

Create a customized theme to make the website unique.

You might want to customize the theme to:

-   Add your company logo
-   Translate the theme text
-   Remove the toolbar in anonymous sites
-   Add a footer that appears on all pages

All of these changes can be done by modifying the default.html file. Add appropriate multilingual support if the theme is being translated. See the HCL Digital Experience documentation for details on theme modification and globalization.

**Note:** The Simple Theme is a custom theme that is not supported with Content Template 4.4.
