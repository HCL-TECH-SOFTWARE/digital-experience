# Customizing sites built with Content Template 

When you customize Content Template Catalog components, you make your website unique, with its own style, user interface, and authoring environment.

-   **[Customizing the theme for Content Template sites ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_theme.md)**  
Create a customized theme to make the website unique.
-   **[Customizing layouts ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_layouts.md)**  
To change the page width or column widths, you change the stylesheet. To add extra layouts, for example to further split up the main column, or to add columns into the other areas of the page, create extra layouts.
-   **[Adding or removing the CTC modules in profiles ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_profiles.md)**  
 To allow site designers to create pages by using the Content Template page template without having to use the CTC Content profile, run the following task to add the CTC modules to all of the Portal default profiles. There is also a task to remove the CTC modules from the Portal theme profiles.
-   **[Providing text providers ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_prov.md)**  
All of the authoring templates, presentation templates, workflows, components, and categories are set up to use a text provider for their titles and descriptions. The Authoring Templates also use the text provider for field labels and prompts.
-   **[Customizing component designs ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_comp.md)**  
Content Template Catalog components are copied into your design library, modified, and then used in page component configurations and portlets. Otherwise, updates to Content Template overwrites changes.
-   **[Overriding presentation templates ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_prestemp.md)**  
To modify the presentation template of a Content Template Catalog content type, you can override a copy of the presentation template through a mapping in your top-level site area, or for a specific site area. The top-level site is usually the best place to make this override.
-   **[Modifying Content Template page templates ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_pagetemp.md)**  
The page templates in Content Template Catalog are pages that reference microsites in the CTC Content library and can be easily changed. You can customize the page with extra portlets by dropping portlets onto the page. If you want to modify the sample content or remove or add more content, you can edit the content in the microsite. The next time that a page is created from this template, the updated page layout, portlets, and content are copied with the new page.
-   **[Creating page templates ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_newtemp.md)**  
You can turn any page into a page template by moving the page into the page templates area in Portal. Then move the accompanying content into the microsites area in CTC Content.
-   **[Creating pre-configured portlets ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_newport.md)**  
When you install Content Template Catalog, the toolbar is enhanced with a new tab under "Applications" called "CTC Portlets", and new page components under the "Content" tab called "Teasers", "Lists", "Slideshows", "Carousels" and "Navigation".
-   **[Creating page component configuration types ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_newconfig.md)**  
The page component configuration types in Content Template Catalog are useful in a wide variety of cases. This flexibility results in configuration types that might be more complex or contain more fields than your authors need. Creating customized page component configuration types allows you to reduce the number of fields or provide more validation for less technical authors.
-   **[Creating new content types ](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_newcont.md)**  
The content types in Content Template Catalog are general enough to be used in most scenarios. However, you can add your own content types for specific purposes, such as tying into internal workflow processes, storing additional information like product codes, or representing highly structured content types.
-   **[Integrating your site with social media ](../ctc/ctc_design_social.md)**  
The Content Template Catalog templates provide sample integration with social media services, but you will typically replace these with a customized implementation.
-   **[Feeds ](../ctc/ctc_arch_feeds.md)**  
Content Template Catalog implements a feed solution that uses HCL Web Content Manager querying components like menu components and personalization components. The feeds are served up as a content item through the HCL Web Content Manager servlet. They have a well-defined URL whose name you can control that remains static over time.
-   **[Print support ](../ctc/ctc_arch_print.md)**  
The pages support printing through a print stylesheet that removes extraneous theme components and unfloats and unconstrains the main content column.
-   **[Tagging and rating for Content Template ](../ctc/ctc_arch_tagging.md)**  
The HCL Digital Experience tagging and rating services are included in many of the Content Template Catalog templates. The services have only been modified with some style overrides to make them fit properly within the Content Template design.
