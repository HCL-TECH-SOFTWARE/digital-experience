# Folder structure
- Documentation source is all in the /docs folder.
- Utility scripts are in the /utils folder.
- Images and other assets are in the /docs/static/assets folder. They are organised into sensible subfolders based on the page that refers to them.

## Committing changes
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
- Use branches for significant changes or new features.
- Identify changes made by copilot in the commit message, e.g., "Added new section on X (with Copilot assistance)".
